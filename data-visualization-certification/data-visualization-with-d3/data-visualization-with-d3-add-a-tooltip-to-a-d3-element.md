Data Visualization with D3: Add a Tooltip to a D3 Element
A tooltip shows more information about an item on a page when the user hovers over that item. There are several ways to add a tooltip to a visualization, this challenge uses the SVG title element.

title pairs with the text() method to dynamically add data to the bars.


Append a title element under each rect node. Then call the text() method with a callback function so the text displays the data value.
