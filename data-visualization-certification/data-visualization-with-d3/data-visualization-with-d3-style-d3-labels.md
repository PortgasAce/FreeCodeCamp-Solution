Data Visualization with D3: Style D3 Labels
D3 methods can add styles to the bar labels. The fill attribute sets the color of the text for a text node. The style() method sets CSS rules for other styles, such as "font-family" or "font-size".


Set the font-size of the text elements to 25px, and the color of the text to red.
