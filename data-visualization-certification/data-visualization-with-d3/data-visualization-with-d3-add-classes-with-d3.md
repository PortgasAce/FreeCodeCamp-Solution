Data Visualization with D3: Add Classes with D3
Using a lot of inline styles on HTML elements gets hard to manage, even for smaller apps. It's easier to add a class to elements and style that class one time using CSS rules. D3 has the attr() method to add any HTML attribute to an element, including a class name.

The attr() method works the same way that style() does. It takes comma-separated values, and can use a callback function. Here's an example to add a class of "container" to a selection:

selection.attr("class", "container");


Add the attr() method to the code in the editor and put a class of bar on the div elements.
```
<style>
  .bar {
    width: 25px;
    height: 100px;
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: blue;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];
    
    d3.select("body").selectAll("div")
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append("div")
      // Add your code below this line
      .attr("class","bar")
      
      
      // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
```
