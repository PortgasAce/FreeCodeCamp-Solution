Data Visualization with D3: Add Inline Styling to Elements
D3 lets you add inline CSS styles on dynamic elements with the style() method.

The style() method takes a comma-separated key-value pair as an argument. Here's an example to set the selection's text color to blue:

selection.style("color","blue");


Add the style() method to the code in the editor to make all the displayed text have a font-family of verdana.
