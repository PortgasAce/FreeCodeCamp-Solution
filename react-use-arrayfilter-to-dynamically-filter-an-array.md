React: Use Array.filter() to Dynamically Filter an Array
The map array method is a powerful tool that you will use often when working with React. Another method related to map is filter, which filters the contents of an array based on a condition, then returns a new array. For example, if you have an array of users that all have a property online which can be set to true or false, you can filter only those users that are online by writing:

let onlineUsers = users.filter(user => user.online);


In the code editor, MyComponent's state is initialized with an array of users. Some users are online and some aren't. Filter the array so you see only the users who are online. To do this, first use filter to return a new array containing only the users whose online property is true. Then, in the renderOnline variable, map over the filtered array, and return a li element for each user that contains the text of their username. Be sure to include a unique key as well, like in the last challenges.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      users: [
        {
          username: 'Jeff',
          online: true
        },
        {
          username: 'Alan',
          online: false
        },
        {
          username: 'Mary',
          online: true
        },
        {
          username: 'Jim',
          online: false
        },
        {
          username: 'Sara',
          online: true
        },
        {
          username: 'Laura',
          online: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  render() {
    const usersOnline = this.state.users.filter((user)=>(user.online)); // change code here
    const renderOnline = usersOnline.map((user)=>(<li key={user.username}>{user.username}</li>)); // change code here
    return (
       <div>
         <h1>Current Online Users:</h1>
         <ul>
           {renderOnline}
         </ul>
       </div>
    );
  }
};
```
