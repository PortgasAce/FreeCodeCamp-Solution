Challenges\nReact, popularized by Facebook, is a open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. With JSX, it is used to create components, handle state and props, utilize event listeners and certain life cycle methods to update data as it changes.\nReact combines HTML with JavaScript functionality to create its own markup language, JSX. This section will introduce you to all of these concepts and how to implement them for use with your own projects.\n"},"react-pass-state-as-props-to-child-components.html":{"url":"react-pass-state-as-props-to-child-components.html","title":"React: Pass State as Props to Child Components","keywords":"","body":"React: Pass State as Props to Child Components\nYou saw a lot of examples that passed props to child JSX elements and child React components in previous challenges. You may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the state important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that state, which are passed in as props.\nFor example, maybe you have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components. In your App, you have state that contains a lot of user information, but the Navbar only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of state to the Navbar component as a prop.\nThis pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is unidirectional data flow. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.\nThe MyApp component is stateful and renders a Navbar component as a child. Pass the name property in its state down to the child component, then show the name in the h1 tag that's part of the Navbar render method.\nclass MyApp extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      name: 'CamperBot'\n    }\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n       \n         \n       \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nclass Navbar extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n    \n      Hello, my name is: {this.props.name} \n    \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-pass-a-callback-as-props.html":{"url":"react-pass-a-callback-as-props.html","title":"React: Pass a Callback as Props","keywords":"","body":"React: Pass a Callback as Props\nYou can pass state as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under this.props in the child component.\nThere are three components outlined in the code editor. The MyApp component is the parent that will render the GetInput and RenderInput child components. Add the GetInput component to the render method in MyApp, then pass it a prop called input assigned to inputValue from MyApp's state. Also create a prop called handleChange and pass the input handler handleChange to it.\nNext, add RenderInput to the render method in MyApp, then create a prop called input and pass the inputValue from state to it. Once you are finished you will be able to type in the input field in the GetInput component, which then calls the handler method in its parent via props. This updates the input in the state of the parent, which is passed as props to both children. Observe how the data flows between the components and how the single source of truth remains the state of the parent component. Admittedly, this example is a bit contrived, but should serve to illustrate how data and callbacks can be passed between React components.\nclass MyApp extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      inputValue: ''\n    }\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleChange(event) {\n    this.setState({\n      inputValue: event.target.value\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n       \n        { /* change code below this line */ }\n        \n        \n        { /* change code above this line */ }\n       \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nclass GetInput extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Get Input:\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nclass RenderInput extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Input Render:\n        {this.props.input}\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-the-lifecycle-method-componentwillmount.html":{"url":"react-use-the-lifecycle-method-componentwillmount.html","title":"React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount","keywords":"","body":"React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount\nReact components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. These are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks, and allow you to catch components at certain points in time. This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods:\ncomponentWillMount()\ncomponentDidMount()\ncomponentWillReceiveProps()\nshouldComponentUpdate()\ncomponentWillUpdate()\ncomponentDidUpdate()\ncomponentWillUnmount()\nThe next several lessons will cover some of the basic use cases for these lifecycle methods.\nThe componentWillMount() method is called before the render() method when a component is being mounted to the DOM. Log something to the console within componentWillMount() - you may want to have your browser console open to see the output.\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  componentWillMount() {\n    // change code below this line\n    console.log(\"componentWillMount\")\n    // change code above this line\n  }\n  render() {\n    return \n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-the-lifecycle-method-componentdidmount.html":{"url":"react-use-the-lifecycle-method-componentdidmount.html","title":"React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount","keywords":"","body":"React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount\nMost web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.\nThe best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method componentDidMount(). This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to setState() here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.\nThere is a mock API call in componentDidMount(). It sets state after 2.5 seconds to simulate calling a server to retrieve data. This example requests the current total active users for a site. In the render method, render the value of activeUsers in the h1. Watch what happens in the preview, and feel free to change the timeout to see the different effects.\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      activeUsers: null\n    };\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    setTimeout( () => {\n      this.setState({\n        activeUsers: 1273\n      });\n    }, 2500);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Active Users: { this.state.activeUsers }\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-add-event-listeners.html":{"url":"react-add-event-listeners.html","title":"React: Add Event Listeners","keywords":"","body":"React: Add Event Listeners\nThe componentDidMount() method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality. React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.\nYou've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as onClick(). React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.\nAttach an event listener in the componentDidMount() method for keydown events and have these events trigger the callback handleKeyPress(). You can use document.addEventListener() which takes the event (in quotes) as the first argument and the callback as the second argument.\nThen, in componentWillUnmount(), remove this same event listener. You can pass the same arguments to document.removeEventListener(). It's good practice to use this lifecycle method to do any clean up on React components before they are unmounted and destroyed. Removing event listeners is an example of one such clean up action.\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      message: ''\n    };\n    this.handleEnter = this.handleEnter.bind(this);\n    this.handleKeyPress = this.handleKeyPress.bind(this);\n  }\n  // change code below this line\n  componentDidMount() {\n     document.addEventListener(\"keydown\",this.handleKeyPress);\n  }\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    document.removeEventListener(\"keydown\",this.handleKeyPress);\n  }\n  // change code above this line\n  handleEnter() {\n    this.setState({\n      message: this.state.message + 'You pressed the enter key! '\n    });\n  }\n  handleKeyPress(event) {\n    if (event.keyCode === 13) {\n      this.handleEnter();\n    }\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.state.message}\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-manage-updates-with-lifecycle-methods.html":{"url":"react-manage-updates-with-lifecycle-methods.html","title":"React: Manage Updates with Lifecycle Methods","keywords":"","body":"React: Manage Updates with Lifecycle Methods\nAnother lifecycle method is componentWillReceiveProps() which is called whenever a component is receiving new props. This method receives the new props as an argument, which is usually written as nextProps. You can use this argument and compare with this.props and perform actions before the component updates. For example, you may call setState() locally before the update is processed.\nAnother method is componentDidUpdate(), and is called immediately after a component re-renders. Note that rendering and mounting are considered different things in the component lifecycle. When a page first loads, all components are mounted and this is where methods like componentWillMount() and componentDidMount() are called. After this, as state changes, components re-render themselves. The next challenge covers this in more detail.\nThe child component Dialog receives message props from its parent, the Controller component. Write the componentWillReceiveProps() method in the Dialog component and have it log this.props and nextProps to the console. You'll need to pass nextProps as an argument to this method and although it's possible to name it anything, name it nextProps here.\nNext, add componentDidUpdate() in the Dialog component, and log a statement that says the component has updated. This method works similar to componentWillUpdate(), which is provided for you. Now click the button to change the message and watch your browser console. The order of the console statements show the order the methods are called.\nNote: You'll need to write the lifecycle methods as normal functions and not as arrow functions to pass the tests (there is also no advantage to writing lifecycle methods as arrow functions).\nclass Dialog extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  componentWillUpdate() {\n    console.log('Component is about to update...');\n  }\n  // change code below this line\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps){\n    console.log('Component will receive props: '+this.props.message+\",next: \"+nextProps.message)\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate(){\n    console.log('Component will receive props: '+this.props.message)\n  }\n\n  // change code above this line\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.message}\n  }\n};\n\nclass Controller extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      message: 'First Message'\n    };\n    this.changeMessage = this.changeMessage.bind(this);\n  }\n  changeMessage() {\n    this.setState({\n      message: 'Second Message'\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Update\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-optimize-re-renders-with-shouldcomponentupdate.html":{"url":"react-optimize-re-renders-with-shouldcomponentupdate.html","title":"React: Optimize Re-Renders with shouldComponentUpdate","keywords":"","body":"React: Optimize Re-Renders with shouldComponentUpdate\nSo far, if any component receives new state or new props, it re-renders itself and all its children. This is usually okay. But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new state or props, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. The method is shouldComponentUpdate(), and it takes nextProps and nextState as parameters.\nThis method is a useful way to optimize performance. For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new props, even if the props haven't changed. You can use shouldComponentUpdate() to prevent this by comparing the props. The method must return a boolean value that tells React whether or not to update the component. You can compare the current props (this.props) to the next props (nextProps) to determine if you need to update or not, and return true or false accordingly.\nThe shouldComponentUpdate() method is added in a component called OnlyEvens. Currently, this method returns true so OnlyEvens re-renders every time it receives new props. Modify the method so OnlyEvens updates only if the value of its new props is even. Click the Add button and watch the order of events in your browser's console as the other lifecycle hooks are triggered.\nclass OnlyEvens extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n    console.log('Should I update?');\n     // change code below this line\n    return nextProps.value%2 !== 1;\n     // change code above this line\n  }\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    console.log('Receiving new props...');\n  }\n  componentDidUpdate() {\n    console.log('Component re-rendered.');\n  }\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.value}\n  }\n};\n\nclass Controller extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      value: 0\n    };\n    this.addValue = this.addValue.bind(this);\n  }\n  addValue() {\n    this.setState({\n      value: this.state.value + 1\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Add\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-introducing-inline-styles.html":{"url":"react-introducing-inline-styles.html","title":"React: Introducing Inline Styles","keywords":"","body":"React: Introducing Inline Styles\nThere are other complex concepts that add powerful capabilities to your React code. But you may be wondering about the more simple problem of how to style those JSX elements you create in React. You likely know that it won't be exactly the same as working with HTML because of the way you apply classes to JSX elements.\nIf you import styles from a stylesheet, it isn't much different at all. You apply a class to your JSX element using the className attribute, and apply styles to the class in your stylesheet. Another option is to apply inline styles, which are very common in ReactJS development.\nYou apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. Here's an example of an inline style in HTML:\nMellow Yellow\nJSX elements use the style attribute, but because of the way JSX is transpiled, you can't set the value to a string. Instead, you set it equal to a JavaScript object. Here's an example:\nMellow Yellow\nNotice how we camelCase the \"fontSize\" property? This is because React will not accept kebab-case keys in the style object. React will apply the correct property name for us in the HTML.\nAdd a style attribute to the div in the code editor to give the text a color of red and font size of 72px.\nNote that you can optionally set the font size to be a number, omitting the units \"px\", or write it as \"72px\".\nclass Colorful extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      Big Red\n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-add-inline-styles-in-react.html":{"url":"react-add-inline-styles-in-react.html","title":"React: Add Inline Styles in React","keywords":"","body":"React: Add Inline Styles in React\nYou may have noticed in the last challenge that there were several other syntax differences from HTML inline styles in addition to the style attribute set to a JavaScript object. First, the names of certain CSS style properties use camel case. For example, the last challenge set the size of the font with fontSize instead of font-size. Hyphenated words like font-size are invalid syntax for JavaScript object properties, so React uses camel case. As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX.\nAll property value length units (like height, width, and fontSize) are assumed to be in px unless otherwise specified. If you want to use em, for example, you wrap the value and the units in quotes, like {fontSize: \"4em\"}. Other than the length values that default to px, all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.\nIf you have a large set of styles, you can assign a style object to a constant to keep your code organized. Uncomment the styles constant and declare an object with three style properties and their values. Give the div a color of \"purple\", a font-size of 40, and a border of \"2px solid purple\". Then set the style attribute equal to the styles constant.\nconst styles ={\"color\":\"purple\",\"fontSize\":40,\"border\":\"2px solid purple\"};\n// change code above this line\nclass Colorful extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    // change code below this line\n    return (\n      Style Me!\n    );\n    // change code above this line\n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-advanced-javascript-in-react-render-method.html":{"url":"react-use-advanced-javascript-in-react-render-method.html","title":"React: Use Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method","keywords":"","body":"React: Use Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method\nIn previous challenges, you learned how to inject JavaScript code into JSX code using curly braces, { }, for tasks like accessing props, passing props, accessing state, inserting comments into your code, and most recently, styling your components. These are all common use cases to put JavaScript in JSX, but they aren't the only way that you can utilize JavaScript code in your React components.\nYou can also write JavaScript directly in your render methods, before the return statement, without inserting it inside of curly braces. This is because it is not yet within the JSX code. When you want to use a variable later in the JSX code inside the return statement, you place the variable name inside curly braces.\nIn the code provided, the render method has an array that contains 20 phrases to represent the answers found in the classic 1980's Magic Eight Ball toy. The button click event is bound to the ask method, so each time the button is clicked a random number will be generated and stored as the randomIndex in state. On line 52, delete the string \"change me!\" and reassign the answer const so your code randomly accesses a different index of the possibleAnswers array each time the component updates.

When the condition is true, one view renders. When it's false, it's a different view. You can do this with a standard if/else statement in the render() method of a React component.\nMyComponent contains a boolean in its state which tracks whether you want to display some element in the UI or not. The button toggles the state of this value. Currently, it renders the same UI every time. Rewrite the render() method with an if/else statement so that if display is true, you return the current markup. Otherwise, return the markup without the h1 element.\nNote: You must write an if/else to pass the tests.

Imagine that you are tracking several conditions in a component and you want different elements to render depending on each of these conditions. If you write a lot of else if statements to return slightly different UIs, you may repeat code which leaves room for error. Instead, you can use the && logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is true, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:\n{condition && markup}\nIf the condition is true, the markup will be returned. If the condition is false, the operation will immediately return false after evaluating the condition and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing && after each one. This allows you to handle more complex conditional logic in your render() method without repeating a lot of code.\nSolve the previous example again, so the h1 only renders if display is true, but use the && logical operator instead of an if/else statement.\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      display: true\n    }\n    this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);\n  }\n  toggleDisplay() {\n    this.setState({\n      display: !this.state.display\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    // change code below this line\n    return (\n       \n         Toggle Display\n         {this.state.display && Displayed!}\n       \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-a-ternary-expression-for-conditional-rendering.html":{"url":"react-use-a-ternary-expression-for-conditional-rendering.html","title":"React: Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering","keywords":"","body":"React: Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering\nBefore moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the ternary operator. The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for if/else statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional if/else statements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, if/else statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago — when an if/else statement was required, it was always outside the return statement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:\ncondition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse\nThe code editor has three constants defined within the CheckUserAge component's render() method. They are called buttonOne, buttonTwo, and buttonThree. Each of these is assigned a simple JSX expression representing a button element. First, initialize the state of CheckUserAge with input and userAge both set to values of an empty string.\nOnce the component is rendering information to the page, users should have a way to interact with it. Within the component's return statement, set up a ternary expression that implements the following logic: when the page first loads, render the submit button, buttonOne, to the page. Then, when a user enters their age and clicks the button, render a different button based on the age. If a user enters a number less than 18, render buttonThree. If a user enters a number greater than or equal to 18, render buttonTwo.\nconst inputStyle = {\n  width: 235,\n  margin: 5\n}\n\nclass CheckUserAge extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    // change code below this line\n    this.state={\n      input: '',\n      userAge: ''\n    }\n    // change code above this line\n    this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleChange(e) {\n    this.setState({\n      input: e.target.value,\n      userAge: ''\n    });\n  }\n  submit() {\n    this.setState({\n      userAge: this.state.input\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    const buttonOne = Submit;\n    const buttonTwo = You May Enter;\n    const buttonThree = You Shall Not Pass;\n    return (\n      \n        Enter Your Age to Continue\n        \n        {\n          ''===this.state.userAge ? buttonOne : (this.state.userAge\n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-render-conditionally-from-props.html":{"url":"react-render-conditionally-from-props.html","title":"React: Render Conditionally from Props","keywords":"","body":"React: Render Conditionally from Props\nSo far, you've seen how to use if/else, &&, null and the ternary operator (condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse) to make conditional decisions about what to render and when. However, there's one important topic left to discuss that lets you combine any or all of these concepts with another powerful React feature: props. Using props to conditionally render code is very common with React developers — that is, they use the value of a given prop to automatically make decisions about what to render.\nIn this challenge, you'll set up a child component to make rendering decisions based on props. You'll also use the ternary operator, but you can see how several of the other concepts that were covered in the last few challenges might be just as useful in this context.\nThe code editor has two components that are partially defined for you: a parent called GameOfChance, and a child called Results. They are used to create a simple game where the user presses a button to see if they win or lose.\nFirst, you'll need a simple expression that randomly returns a different value every time it is run. You can use Math.random(). This method returns a value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) each time it is called. So for 50/50 odds, use Math.random() > .5 in your expression. Statistically speaking, this expression will return true 50% of the time, and false the other 50%. On line 30, replace the comment with this expression to complete the variable declaration.\nNow you have an expression that you can use to make a randomized decision in the code. Next you need to implement this. Render the Results component as a child of GameOfChance, and pass in expression as a prop called fiftyFifty. In the Results component, write a ternary expression to render the text \"You win!\" or \"You lose!\" based on the fiftyFifty prop that's being passed in from GameOfChance. Finally, make sure the handleClick() method is correctly counting each turn so the user knows how many times they've played. This also serves to let the user know the component has actually updated in case they win or lose twice in a row.\nclass Results extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n      {\n        this.props.fiftyFifty ? \"You win!\":\"You lose!\"\n        /* change code here */\n      }\n      \n    )\n  };\n};\n\nclass GameOfChance extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      counter: 1\n    }\n    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleClick() {\n    this.setState({\n      counter: ++this.state.counter // change code here\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    let expression = Math.random() > .5; // change code here\n    return (\n      \n        Play Again\n        { /* change code below this line */ }\n        \n        { /* change code above this line */ }\n        {'Turn: ' + this.state.counter}\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-change-inline-css-conditionally-based-on-component-state.html":{"url":"react-change-inline-css-conditionally-based-on-component-state.html","title":"React: Change Inline CSS Conditionally Based on Component State","keywords":"","body":"React: Change Inline CSS Conditionally Based on Component State\nAt this point, you've seen several applications of conditional rendering and the use of inline styles. Here's one more example that combines both of these topics. You can also render CSS conditionally based on the state of a React component. To do this, you check for a condition, and if that condition is met, you modify the styles object that's assigned to the JSX elements in the render method.\nThis paradigm is important to understand because it is a dramatic shift from the more traditional approach of applying styles by modifying DOM elements directly (which is very common with jQuery, for example). In that approach, you must keep track of when elements change and also handle the actual manipulation directly. It can become difficult to keep track of changes, potentially making your UI unpredictable. When you set a style object based on a condition, you describe how the UI should look as a function of the application's state. There is a clear flow of information that only moves in one direction. This is the preferred method when writing applications with React.\nThe code editor has a simple controlled input component with a styled border. You want to style this border red if the user types more than 15 characters of text in the input box. Add a condition to check for this and, if the condition is valid, set the input border style to 3px solid red. You can try it out by entering text in the input.\n\nclass GateKeeper extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      input: ''\n    };\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleChange(event) {\n    this.setState({ input: event.target.value })\n  }\n  render() {\n    let inputStyle = {\n      border: '1px solid black'\n    };\n    // change code below this line\n    if(this.state.input.length>15){\n      inputStyle={\n         border: '3px solid red'\n      }\n    }\n    // change code above this line\n    return (\n      \n        Don't Type Too Much:\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-arraymap-to-dynamically-render-elements.html":{"url":"react-use-arraymap-to-dynamically-render-elements.html","title":"React: Use Array.map() to Dynamically Render Elements","keywords":"","body":"React: Use Array.map() to Dynamically Render Elements\nConditional rendering is useful, but you may need your components to render an unknown number of elements. Often in reactive programming, a programmer has no way to know what the state of an application is until runtime, because so much depends on a user's interaction with that program. Programmers need to write their code to correctly handle that unknown state ahead of time. Using Array.map() in React illustrates this concept.\nFor example, you create a simple \"To Do List\" app. As the programmer, you have no way of knowing how many items a user might have on their list. You need to set up your component to dynamically render the correct number of list elements long before someone using the program decides that today is laundry day.\nThe code editor has most of the MyToDoList component set up. Some of this code should look familiar if you completed the controlled form challenge. You'll notice a textarea and a button, along with a couple of methods that track their states, but nothing is rendered to the page yet.\nInside the constructor, create a this.state object and define two states: userInput should be initialized as an empty string, and toDoList should be initialized as an empty array. Next, delete the comment in the render() method next to the items variable. In its place, map over the toDoList array stored in the component's internal state and dynamically render a li for each item. Try entering the string eat, code, sleep, repeat into the textarea, then click the button and see what happens.\nNote: You may know that all sibling child elements created by a mapping operation like this do need to be supplied with a unique key attribute.

React uses these keys to keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way. Note that keys only need to be unique between sibling elements, they don't need to be globally unique in your application.\nThe code editor has an array with some front end frameworks and a stateless functional component named Frameworks().

Normally, this is what you will always do. However, there are some use cases where it makes sense to render a React component on the server. Since React is a JavaScript view library and you can run JavaScript on the server with Node, this is possible. In fact, React provides a renderToString() method you can use for this purpose.\nThere are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. First, without doing this, your React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JavaScript when it's initially loaded to the browser. This may not be ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your pages so people can find you. If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client, the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines. Second, this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller than the JavaScript code of the entire app. React will still be able to recognize your app and manage it after the initial load.\nThe renderToString() method is provided on ReactDOMServer, which is available here as a global object. The method takes one argument which is a React element.

This means if you had a React app with ten components, and each component had its own local state, the entire state of your app would be defined by a single state object housed in the Redux store. This is the first important principle to understand when learning Redux: the Redux store is the single source of truth when it comes to application state.\nThis also means that any time any piece of your app wants to update state, it must do so through the Redux store. The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to track state management in your app.\nThe Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state. There is a method called createStore() on the Redux object, which you use to create the Redux store. This method takes a reducer function as a required argument. The reducer function is covered in a later challenge, and is already defined for you in the code editor. It simply takes state as an argument and returns state.\nDeclare a store variable and assign it to the createStore() method, passing in the reducer as an argument.\nNote: The code in the editor uses ES6 default argument syntax to initialize this state to hold a value of 5. If you're not familiar with default arguments, you can refer to the ES6 section in the Curriculum which covers this topic.\nconst reducer = (state = 5) => {\n  return state;\n}\n\n// Redux methods are available from a Redux object\n// For example: Redux.createStore()\n// Define the store here:\nconst store = Redux.createStore(reducer);\n"},"redux/redux-get-state-from-the-redux-store.html":{"url":"redux/redux-get-state-from-the-redux-store.html","title":"Redux: Get State from the Redux Store","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Get State from the Redux Store\nThe Redux store object provides several methods that allow you to interact with it. For example, you can retrieve the current state held in the Redux store object with the getState() method.\nThe code from the previous challenge is re-written more concisely in the code editor. Use store.getState() to retrieve the state from the store, and assign this to a new variable currentState.\nconst store = Redux.createStore(\n  (state = 5) => state\n);\n\n// change code below this line\nlet currentState = store.getState();\n"},"redux/redux-define-a-redux-action.html":{"url":"redux/redux-define-a-redux-action.html","title":"Redux: Define a Redux Action","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Define a Redux Action\nSince Redux is a state management framework, updating state is one of its core tasks. In Redux, all state updates are triggered by dispatching actions. An action is simply a JavaScript object that contains information about an action event that has occurred. The Redux store receives these action objects, then updates its state accordingly. Sometimes a Redux action also carries some data. For example, the action carries a username after a user logs in. While the data is optional, actions must carry a type property that specifies the 'type' of action that occurred.\nThink of Redux actions as messengers that deliver information about events happening in your app to the Redux store. The store then conducts the business of updating state based on the action that occurred.\nWriting a Redux action is as simple as declaring an object with a type property. Declare an object action and give it a property type set to the string 'LOGIN'.\n// Define an action here:\nlet action = {type: 'LOGIN'}\n"},"redux/redux-define-an-action-creator.html":{"url":"redux/redux-define-an-action-creator.html","title":"Redux: Define an Action Creator","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Define an Action Creator\nAfter creating an action, the next step is sending the action to the Redux store so it can update its state.

Then the method dispatches an action object to the Redux store. Based on the previous challenge's example, the following lines are equivalent, and both dispatch the action of type LOGIN:\nstore.dispatch(actionCreator());\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'LOGIN' });\nThe Redux store in the code editor has an initialized state that's an object containing a login property currently set to false. There's also an action creator called loginAction() which returns an action of type LOGIN. Dispatch the LOGIN action to the Redux store by calling the dispatch method, and pass in the action created by loginAction().\nconst store = Redux.createStore(\n  (state = {login: false}) => state\n);\n\nconst loginAction = () => {\n  return {\n    type: 'LOGIN'\n  }\n};\n\n// Dispatch the action here:\nstore.dispatch(loginAction());\n"},"redux/redux-handle-an-action-in-the-store.html":{"url":"redux/redux-handle-an-action-in-the-store.html","title":"Redux: Handle an Action in the Store","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Handle an Action in the Store\nAfter an action is created and dispatched, the Redux store needs to know how to respond to that action. This is the job of a reducer function. Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A reducer takes state and action as arguments, and it always returns a new state. It is important to see that this is the only role of the reducer. It has no side effects — it never calls an API endpoint and it never has any hidden surprises. The reducer is simply a pure function that takes state and action, then returns new state.\nAnother key principle in Redux is that state is read-only. In other words, the reducer function must always return a new copy of state and never modify state directly. Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, you are responsible for enforcing it in the code of your reducer functions. You'll practice this in later challenges.\nThe code editor has the previous example as well as the start of a reducer function for you. Fill in the body of the reducer function so that if it receives an action of type 'LOGIN' it returns a state object with login set to true. Otherwise, it returns the current state. Note that the current state and the dispatched action are passed to the reducer, so you can access the action's type directly with action.type.\nconst defaultState = {\n  login: false\n};\n\nconst reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {\n  // change code below this line\n if(action.type === \"LOGIN\"){\n    return {login:true};\n  }\n  return state;\n  // change code above this line\n};\n\nconst store = Redux.createStore(reducer);\n\nconst loginAction = () => {\n  return {\n    type: 'LOGIN'\n  }\n};\n"},"redux/redux-use-a-switch-statement-to-handle-multiple-actions.html":{"url":"redux/redux-use-a-switch-statement-to-handle-multiple-actions.html","title":"Redux: Use a Switch Statement to Handle Multiple Actions","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Use a Switch Statement to Handle Multiple Actions\nYou can tell the Redux store how to handle multiple action types. Say you are managing user authentication in your Redux store. You want to have a state representation for when users are logged in and when they are logged out. You represent this with a single state object with the property authenticated. You also need action creators that create actions corresponding to user login and user logout, along with the action objects themselves.\nThe code editor has a store, actions, and action creators set up for you. Fill in the reducer function to handle multiple authentication actions. Use a JavaScript switch statement in the reducer to respond to different action events. This is a standard pattern in writing Redux reducers. The switch statement should switch over action.type and return the appropriate authentication state.\nNote: At this point, don't worry about state immutability, since it is small and simple in this example. For each action, you can return a new object — for example, {authenticated: true}. Also, don't forget to write a default case in your switch statement that returns the current state. This is important because once your app has multiple reducers, they are all run any time an action dispatch is made, even when the action isn't related to that reducer. In such a case, you want to make sure that you return the current state.\nconst defaultState = {\n  authenticated: false\n};\n\nconst authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {\n  // change code below this line\n  switch(action.type){\n    case 'LOGIN':\n      return {authenticated: true};\n    case 'LOGOUT':\n      return {authenticated: false};\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n  // change code above this line\n};\n\nconst store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);\n\nconst loginUser = () => {\n  return {\n    type: 'LOGIN'\n  }\n};\n\nconst logoutUser = () => {\n  return {\n    type: 'LOGOUT'\n  }\n};\n"},"redux/redux-use-const-for-action-types.html":{"url":"redux/redux-use-const-for-action-types.html","title":"Redux: Use const for Action Types","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Use const for Action Types\nA common practice when working with Redux is to assign action types as read-only constants, then reference these constants wherever they are used.

This allows you to subscribe listener functions to the store, which are called whenever an action is dispatched against the store. One simple use for this method is to subscribe a function to your store that simply logs a message every time an action is received and the store is updated.\nWrite a callback function that increments the global variable count every time the store receives an action, and pass this function in to the store.subscribe() method. You'll see that store.dispatch() is called three times in a row, each time directly passing in an action object. Watch the console output between the action dispatches to see the updates take place.\nconst ADD = 'ADD';\n\nconst reducer = (state = 0, action) => {\n  switch(action.type) {\n    case ADD:\n      return state + 1;\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nconst store = Redux.createStore(reducer);\n\n// global count variable:\nlet count = 0;\n\n// change code below this line\nstore.subscribe(()=>count++);\n// change code above this line\n\nstore.dispatch({type: ADD});\nconsole.log(count);\nstore.dispatch({type: ADD});\nconsole.log(count);\nstore.dispatch({type: ADD});\nconsole.log(count);\n"},"redux/redux-combine-multiple-reducers.html":{"url":"redux/redux-combine-multiple-reducers.html","title":"Redux: Combine Multiple Reducers","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Combine Multiple Reducers\nWhen the state of your app begins to grow more complex, it may be tempting to divide state into multiple pieces. Instead, remember the first principle of Redux: all app state is held in a single state object in the store. Therefore, Redux provides reducer composition as a solution for a complex state model. You define multiple reducers to handle different pieces of your application's state, then compose these reducers together into one root reducer. The root reducer is then passed into the Redux createStore() method.\nIn order to let us combine multiple reducers together, Redux provides the combineReducers() method. This method accepts an object as an argument in which you define properties which associate keys to specific reducer functions. The name you give to the keys will be used by Redux as the name for the associated piece of state.\nTypically, it is a good practice to create a reducer for each piece of application state when they are distinct or unique in some way. For example, in a note-taking app with user authentication, one reducer could handle authentication while another handles the text and notes that the user is submitting. For such an application, we might write the combineReducers() method like this:\nconst rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({\n  auth: authenticationReducer,\n  notes: notesReducer\n});\nNow, the key notes will contain all of the state associated with our notes and handled by our notesReducer. This is how multiple reducers can be composed to manage more complex application state. In this example, the state held in the Redux store would then be a single object containing auth and notes properties.\nThere are counterReducer() and authReducer() functions provided in the code editor, along with a Redux store.

You can also send specific data along with your actions. In fact, this is very common because actions usually originate from some user interaction and tend to carry some data with them. The Redux store often needs to know about this data.\nThere's a basic notesReducer() and an addNoteText() action creator defined in the code editor. Finish the body of the addNoteText() function so that it returns an action object. The object should include a type property with a value of ADD_NOTE, and also a text property set to the note data that's passed into the action creator. When you call the action creator, you'll pass in specific note information that you can access for the object.\nNext, finish writing the switch statement in the notesReducer(). You need to add a case that handles the addNoteText() actions. This case should be triggered whenever there is an action of type ADD_NOTE and it should return the text property on the incoming action as the new state.\nThe action is dispatched at the bottom of the code.

At some point you'll need to call asynchronous endpoints in your Redux app, so how do you handle these types of requests? Redux provides middleware designed specifically for this purpose, called Redux Thunk middleware. Here's a brief description how to use this with Redux.\nTo include Redux Thunk middleware, you pass it as an argument to Redux.applyMiddleware(). This statement is then provided as a second optional parameter to the createStore() function. Take a look at the code at the bottom of the editor to see this. Then, to create an asynchronous action, you return a function in the action creator that takes dispatch as an argument. Within this function, you can dispatch actions and perform asynchronous requests.\nIn this example, an asynchronous request is simulated with a setTimeout() call. It's common to dispatch an action before initiating any asynchronous behavior so that your application state knows that some data is being requested (this state could display a loading icon, for instance). Then, once you receive the data, you dispatch another action which carries the data as a payload along with information that the action is completed.\nRemember that you're passing dispatch as a parameter to this special action creator. This is what you'll use to dispatch your actions, you simply pass the action directly to dispatch and the middleware takes care of the rest.\nWrite both dispatches in the handleAsync() action creator. Dispatch requestingData() before the setTimeout() (the simulated API call). Then, after you receive the (pretend) data, dispatch the receivedData() action, passing in this data.

Immutable state means that you never modify state directly, instead, you return a new copy of state.\nIf you took a snapshot of the state of a Redux app over time, you would see something like state 1, state 2, state 3,state 4, ... and so on where each state may be similar to the last, but each is a distinct piece of data. This immutability, in fact, is what provides such features as time-travel debugging that you may have heard about.\nRedux does not actively enforce state immutability in its store or reducers, that responsibility falls on the programmer. Fortunately, JavaScript (especially ES6) provides several useful tools you can use to enforce the immutability of your state, whether it is a string, number, array, or object. Note that strings and numbers are primitive values and are immutable by nature. In other words, 3 is always 3. You cannot change the value of the number 3. An array or object, however, is mutable. In practice, your state will probably consist of an array or object, as these are useful data structures for representing many types of information.\nThere is a store and reducer in the code editor for managing to-do items. Finish writing the ADD_TO_DO case in the reducer to append a new to-do to the state. There are a few ways to accomplish this with standard JavaScript or ES6.

This is relatively new, but commonly used syntax. For example, if you have an array myArray and write:\nlet newArray = [...myArray];\nnewArray is now a clone of myArray. Both arrays still exist separately in memory. If you perform a mutation like newArray.push(5), myArray doesn't change. The ... effectively spreads out the values in myArray into a new array. To clone an array but add additional values in the new array, you could write [...myArray, 'new value']. This would return a new array composed of the values in myArray and the string 'new value' as the last value. The spread syntax can be used multiple times in array composition like this, but it's important to note that it only makes a shallow copy of the array.

Any matching properties are overwritten by properties in the source objects. This behavior is commonly used to make shallow copies of objects by passing an empty object as the first argument followed by the object(s) you want to copy.

First, here's a review of some of the key principles of each technology. React is a view library that you provide with data, then it renders the view in an efficient, predictable way. Redux is a state management framework that you can use to simplify the management of your application's state. Typically, in a React Redux app, you create a single Redux store that manages the state of your entire app. Your React components subscribe to only the pieces of data in the store that are relevant to their role. Then, you dispatch actions directly from React components, which then trigger store updates.\nAlthough React components can manage their own state locally, when you have a complex app, it's generally better to keep the app state in a single location with Redux. There are exceptions when individual components may have local state specific only to them. Finally, because Redux is not designed to work with React out of the box, you need to use the react-redux package. It provides a way for you to pass Redux state and dispatch to your React components as props.\nOver the next few challenges, first, you'll create a simple React component which allows you to input new text messages. These are added to an array that's displayed in the view. This should be a nice review of what you learned in the React lessons. Next, you'll create a Redux store and actions that manage the state of the messages array. Finally, you'll use react-redux to connect the Redux store with your component, thereby extracting the local state into the Redux store.\nStart with a DisplayMessages component. Add a constructor to this component and initialize it with a state that has two properties: input, that's set to an empty string, and messages, that's set to an empty array.\nclass DisplayMessages extends React.Component {\n  // change code below this line\n  constructor(props){\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      input: '',\n      messages:[]\n    }\n  }\n  // change code above this line\n  render() {\n    return \n  }\n};\n"},"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-manage-state-locally-first.html":{"url":"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-manage-state-locally-first.html","title":"React and Redux: Manage State Locally First","keywords":"","body":"React and Redux: Manage State Locally First\nHere you'll finish creating the DisplayMessages component.\nFirst, in the render() method, have the component render an input element, button element, and ul element. When the input element changes, it should trigger a handleChange() method. Also, the input element should render the value of input that's in the component's state. The button element should trigger a submitMessage() method when it's clicked.\nSecond, write these two methods. The handleChange() method should update the input with what the user is typing. The submitMessage() method should concatenate the current message (stored in input) to the messages array in local state, and clear the value of the input.\nFinally, use the ul to map over the array of messages and render it to the screen as a list of li elements.\nclass DisplayMessages extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      input: '',\n      messages: []\n    }\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)\n    this.submitMessage = this.submitMessage.bind(this)\n  }\n  // add handleChange() and submitMessage() methods here\n  handleChange(event){\n    this.setState({\n      input:event.target.value\n    })\n  }\n\n  submitMessage(){\n    let intputVal = this.state.input;\n    let arr = [...this.state.messages,intputVal];\n    this.setState({\n      input:'',\n      messages:arr\n    })\n\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const items = this.state.messages.map((items) => ({items}));\n\n    return (\n      \n        Type in a new Message:\n        { /* render an input, button, and ul here */ }\n        \n        submit\n        \n          {items}\n        \n        { /* change code above this line */ }\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-extract-state-logic-to-redux.html":{"url":"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-extract-state-logic-to-redux.html","title":"React and Redux: Extract State Logic to Redux","keywords":"","body":"React and Redux: Extract State Logic to Redux\nNow that you finished the React component, you need to move the logic it's performing locally in its state into Redux. This is the first step to connect the simple React app to Redux. The only functionality your app has is to add new messages from the user to an unordered list. The example is simple in order to demonstrate how React and Redux work together.\nFirst, define an action type 'ADD' and set it to a const ADD. Next, define an action creator addMessage() which creates the action to add a message. You'll need to pass a message to this action creator and include the message in the returned action.\nThen create a reducer called messageReducer() that handles the state for the messages. The initial state should equal an empty array. This reducer should add a message to the array of messages held in state, or return the current state. Finally, create your Redux store and pass it the reducer.\n// define ADD, addMessage(), messageReducer(), and store here:\nconst ADD = 'ADD'\n\nlet addMessage =(msg)=> {\n    return {\n        type: ADD,\n        message: msg\n    };\n}\n\nlet messageReducer =(state = [],action) =>{\n    switch(action.type){\n        case ADD:\n        return [...state,action.message];\n        default:\n        return state;\n    }\n}\n\nlet store = Redux.createStore(messageReducer);\n"},"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-use-provider-to-connect-redux-to-react.html":{"url":"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-use-provider-to-connect-redux-to-react.html","title":"React and Redux: Use Provider to Connect Redux to React","keywords":"","body":"React and Redux: Use Provider to Connect Redux to React\nIn the last challenge, you created a Redux store to handle the messages array and created an action for adding new messages. The next step is to provide React access to the Redux store and the actions it needs to dispatch updates. React Redux provides its react-redux package to help accomplish these tasks.\nReact Redux provides a small API with two key features: Provider and connect. Another challenge covers connect. The Provider is a wrapper component from React Redux that wraps your React app. This wrapper then allows you to access the Redux store and dispatch functions throughout your component tree. Provider takes two props, the Redux store and the child components of your app. Defining the Provider for an App component might look like this:\n\n  \n\nThe code editor now shows all your Redux and React code from the past several challenges. It includes the Redux store, actions, and the DisplayMessages component. The only new piece is the AppWrapper component at the bottom. Use this top level component to render the Provider from ReactRedux, and pass the Redux store as a prop. Then render the DisplayMessages component as a child. Once you are finished, you should see your React component rendered to the page.\nNote: React Redux is available as a global variable here, so you can access the Provider with dot notation. The code in the editor takes advantage of this and sets it to a constant Provider for you to use in the AppWrapper render method.\n// Redux Code:\nconst ADD = 'ADD';\n\nconst addMessage = (message) => {\n  return {\n    type: ADD,\n    message\n  }\n};\n\nconst messageReducer = (state = [], action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD:\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        action.message\n      ];\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\n\n\nconst store = Redux.createStore(messageReducer);\n\n// React Code:\n\nclass DisplayMessages extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      input: '',\n      messages: []\n    }\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n    this.submitMessage = this.submitMessage.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleChange(event) {\n    this.setState({\n      input: event.target.value\n    });\n  }\n  submitMessage() {\n    const currentMessage = this.state.input;\n    this.setState({\n      input: '',\n      messages: this.state.messages.concat(currentMessage)\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Type in a new Message:\n        \n        Submit\n        \n          {this.state.messages.map( (message, idx) => {\n              return (\n                 {message}\n              )\n            })\n          }\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nconst Provider = ReactRedux.Provider;\n\nclass AppWrapper extends React.Component {\n  // render the Provider here\n  render(){\n      return(\n        \n            \n        )\n  }\n  // change code above this line\n};\n"},"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-map-state-to-props.html":{"url":"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-map-state-to-props.html","title":"React and Redux: Map State to Props","keywords":"","body":"React and Redux: Map State to Props\nThe Provider component allows you to provide state and dispatch to your React components, but you must specify exactly what state and actions you want. This way, you make sure that each component only has access to the state it needs. You accomplish this by creating two functions: mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps().\nIn these functions, you declare what pieces of state you want to have access to and which action creators you need to be able to dispatch. Once these functions are in place, you'll see how to use the React Redux connect method to connect them to your components in another challenge.\nNote: Behind the scenes, React Redux uses the store.subscribe() method to implement mapStateToProps().\nCreate a function mapStateToProps(). This function should take state as an argument, then return an object which maps that state to specific property names. These properties will become accessible to your component via props. Since this example keeps the entire state of the app in a single array, you can pass that entire state to your component. Create a property messages in the object that's being returned, and set it to state.\nconst state = [];\n\n// change code below this line\nlet mapStateToProps = (state) =>{\n    return{\n        messages: state\n    }\n}\n"},"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-map-dispatch-to-props.html":{"url":"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-map-dispatch-to-props.html","title":"React and Redux: Map Dispatch to Props","keywords":"","body":"React and Redux: Map Dispatch to Props\nThe mapDispatchToProps() function is used to provide specific action creators to your React components so they can dispatch actions against the Redux store. It's similar in structure to the mapStateToProps() function you wrote in the last challenge. It returns an object that maps dispatch actions to property names, which become component props. However, instead of returning a piece of state, each property returns a function that calls dispatch with an action creator and any relevant action data. You have access to this dispatch because it's passed in to mapDispatchToProps() as a parameter when you define the function, just like you passed state to mapStateToProps(). Behind the scenes, React Redux is using Redux's store.dispatch() to conduct these dispatches with mapDispatchToProps(). This is similar to how it uses store.subscribe() for components that are mapped to state.\nFor example, you have a loginUser() action creator that takes a username as an action payload. The object returned from mapDispatchToProps() for this action creator would look something like:\n{\n  submitLoginUser: function(username) {\n    dispatch(loginUser(username));\n  }\n}\nThe code editor provides an action creator called addMessage(). Write the function mapDispatchToProps() that takes dispatch as an argument, then returns an object. The object should have a property submitNewMessage set to the dispatch function, which takes a parameter for the new message to add when it dispatches addMessage().\nconst addMessage = (message) => {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD',\n    message: message\n  }\n};\n\n// change code below this line\nfunction mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {\n    return{\n        submitNewMessage: function(message){\n            dispatch(addMessage(message))\n        }\n    }\n}\n"},"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-connect-redux-to-react.html":{"url":"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-connect-redux-to-react.html","title":"React and Redux: Connect Redux to React","keywords":"","body":"React and Redux: Connect Redux to React\nNow that you've written both the mapStateToProps() and the mapDispatchToProps() functions, you can use them to map state and dispatch to the props of one of your React components. The connect method from React Redux can handle this task. This method takes two optional arguments, mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps(). They are optional because you may have a component that only needs access to state but doesn't need to dispatch any actions, or vice versa.\nTo use this method, pass in the functions as arguments, and immediately call the result with your component. This syntax is a little unusual and looks like:\nconnect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent)\nNote: If you want to omit one of the arguments to the connect method, you pass null in its place.\nThe code editor has the mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps() functions and a new React component called Presentational. Connect this component to Redux with the connect method from the ReactRedux global object, and call it immediately on the Presentational component. Assign the result to a new const called ConnectedComponent that represents the connected component. That's it, now you're connected to Redux! Try changing either of connect's arguments to null and observe the test results.\nconst addMessage = (message) => {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD',\n    message: message\n  }\n};\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  return {\n    messages: state\n  }\n};\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    submitNewMessage: (message) => {\n      dispatch(addMessage(message));\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nclass Presentational extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return This is a Presentational Component\n  }\n};\n\nconst connect = ReactRedux.connect;\n// change code below this line\nconst ConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(Presentational);\n"},"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-connect-redux-to-the-messages-app.html":{"url":"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-connect-redux-to-the-messages-app.html","title":"React and Redux: Connect Redux to the Messages App","keywords":"","body":"React and Redux: Connect Redux to the Messages App\nNow that you understand how to use connect to connect React to Redux, you can apply what you've learned to your React component that handles messages.\nIn the last lesson, the component you connected to Redux was named Presentational, and this wasn't arbitrary. This term generally refers to React components that are not directly connected to Redux. They are simply responsible for the presentation of UI and do this as a function of the props they receive. By contrast, container components are connected to Redux. These are typically responsible for dispatching actions to the store and often pass store state to child components as props.\nThe code editor has all the code you've written in this section so far. The only change is that the React component is renamed to Presentational. Create a new component held in a constant called Container that uses connect to connect the Presentational component to Redux. Then, in the AppWrapper, render the React Redux Provider component. Pass Provider the Redux store as a prop and render Container as a child. Once everything is setup, you will see the messages app rendered to the page again.\n// Redux:\nconst ADD = 'ADD';\n\nconst addMessage = (message) => {\n  return {\n    type: ADD,\n    message: message\n  }\n};\n\nconst messageReducer = (state = [], action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD:\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        action.message\n      ];\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nconst store = Redux.createStore(messageReducer);\n\n// React:\nclass Presentational extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      input: '',\n      messages: []\n    }\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n    this.submitMessage = this.submitMessage.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleChange(event) {\n    this.setState({\n      input: event.target.value\n    });\n  }\n  submitMessage() {\n    const currentMessage = this.state.input;\n    this.setState({\n      input: '',\n      messages: this.state.messages.concat(currentMessage)\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Type in a new Message:\n        \n        Submit\n        \n          {this.state.messages.map( (message, idx) => {\n              return (\n                 {message}\n              )\n            })\n          }\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n\n// React-Redux:\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  return { messages: state }\n};\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    submitNewMessage: (newMessage) => {\n       dispatch(addMessage(newMessage))\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nconst Provider = ReactRedux.Provider;\nconst connect = ReactRedux.connect;\n\n// define the Container component here:\nconst Container = connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(Presentational);\n\nclass AppWrapper extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    // complete the return statement:\n    return (\n      \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-extract-local-state-into-redux.html":{"url":"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-extract-local-state-into-redux.html","title":"React and Redux: Extract Local State into Redux","keywords":"","body":"React and Redux: Extract Local State into Redux\nYou're almost done! Recall that you wrote all the Redux code so that Redux could control the state management of your React messages app. Now that Redux is connected, you need to extract the state management out of the Presentational component and into Redux. Currently, you have Redux connected, but you are handling the state locally within the Presentational component.\nIn the Presentational component, first, remove the messages property in the local state. These messages will be managed by Redux. Next, modify the submitMessage() method so that it dispatches submitNewMessage() from this.props, and pass in the current message input from local state as an argument. Because you removed messages from local state, remove the messages property from the call to this.setState() here as well. Finally, modify the render() method so that it maps over the messages received from props rather than state.\nOnce these changes are made, the app will continue to function the same, except Redux manages the state. This example also illustrates how a component may have local state: your component still tracks user input locally in its own state. You can see how Redux provides a useful state management framework on top of React. You achieved the same result using only React's local state at first, and this is usually possible with simple apps. However, as your apps become larger and more complex, so does your state management, and this is the problem Redux solves.\n// Redux:\nconst ADD = 'ADD';\n\nconst addMessage = (message) => {\n  return {\n    type: ADD,\n    message: message\n  }\n};\n\nconst messageReducer = (state = [], action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case ADD:\n      return [\n        ...state,\n        action.message\n      ];\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nconst store = Redux.createStore(messageReducer);\n\n// React:\nconst Provider = ReactRedux.Provider;\nconst connect = ReactRedux.connect;\n\n// Change code below this line\nclass Presentational extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      input: '',\n    }\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n    this.submitMessage = this.submitMessage.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleChange(event) {\n    this.setState({\n      input: event.target.value\n    });\n  }\n  submitMessage() {\n    this.props.submitNewMessage(this.state.input)\n    this.setState({\n      input: ''\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Type in a new Message:\n        \n        Submit\n        \n          {this.props.messages.map( (message, idx) => {\n              return (\n                 {message}\n              )\n            })\n          }\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n// Change code above this line\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  return {messages: state}\n};\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {\n  return {\n    submitNewMessage: (message) => {\n      dispatch(addMessage(message))\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nconst Container = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Presentational);\n\nclass AppWrapper extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-moving-forward-from-here.html":{"url":"react-and-redux/react-and-redux-moving-forward-from-here.html","title":"React and Redux: Moving Forward From Here","keywords":"","body":"React and Redux: Moving Forward From Here\nCongratulations!

When you have a set of data, you can apply D3 methods to display it on the page. Data comes in many formats, but this challenge uses a simple array of numbers.\nThe first step is to make D3 aware of the data. The data() method is used on a selection of DOM elements to attach the data to those elements. The data set is passed as an argument to the method.\nA common workflow pattern is to create a new element in the document for each piece of data in the set. D3 has the enter() method for this purpose.\nWhen enter() is combined with the data() method, it looks at the selected elements from the page and compares them to the number of data items in the set. If there are fewer elements than data items, it creates the missing elements.\nHere is an example that selects a ul element and creates a new list item based on the number of entries in the array:\n\n  \n  \n    const dataset = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\n    d3.select(\"ul\").selectAll(\"li\")\n      .data(dataset)\n      .enter()\n      .append(\"li\")\n      .text(\"New item\");\n  \n\nIt may seem confusing to select elements that don't exist yet. This code is telling D3 to first select the ul on the page. Next, select all list items, which returns an empty selection. Then the data() method reviews the dataset and runs the following code three times, once for each item in the array. The enter() method sees there are no li elements on the page, but it needs 3 (one for each piece of data in dataset). New li elements are appended to the ul and have the text \"New item\".\nSelect the body node, then select all h2 elements. Have D3 create and append an h2 tag for each item in the dataset array. The text in the h2 should say \"New Title\". Your code should use the data() and enter() methods.\n\n  \n    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];\n\n    // Add your code below this line\n    d3.select(\"body\")\n    .selectAll(\"h2\")\n    .data(dataset)\n    .enter()\n    .append(\"h2\")\n    .text(\"New Title\");\n\n\n    // Add your code above this line\n  \n\n"},"data-visualization-certification/data-visualization-with-d3/data-visualization-with-d3-work-with-dynamic-data-in-d3.html":{"url":"data-visualization-certification/data-visualization-with-d3/data-visualization-with-d3-work-with-dynamic-data-in-d3.html","title":"Data Visualization with D3: Work with Dynamic Data in D3","keywords":"","body":"Data Visualization with D3: Work with Dynamic Data in D3\nThe last two challenges cover the basics of displaying data dynamically with D3 using the data() and enter() methods.

This is because you have not made use of the data that is bound to each of the h2 elements.\nThe D3 text() method can take a string or a callback function as an argument:\nselection.text((d) => d)\nIn the example above, the parameter d refers to a single entry in the dataset that a selection is bound to.\nUsing the current example as context, the first h2 element is bound to 12, the second h2 element is bound to 31, the third h2 element is bound to 22, and so on.\nChange the text() method so that each h2 element displays the corresponding value from the dataset array with a single space and \"USD\".

You can use a callback function in the style() method and include the conditional logic. The callback function uses the d parameter to represent the data point:\nselection.style(\"color\", (d) => {\n  / Logic that returns the color based on a condition /\n});\nThe style() method is not limited to setting the color - it can be used with other CSS properties as well.\nAdd the style() method to the code in the editor to set the color of the h2 elements conditionally.

Since D3 maps data into a visual representation, it uses SVG to create the shapes for the visualization. SVG shapes for a web page must go within an HTML svg tag.\nCSS can be scalable when styles use relative units (such as vh, vw, or percentages), but using SVG is more flexible to build data visualizations.\nAdd an svg node to the body using append().

For example, a rectangle () SVG shape could create a bar in a bar chart.\nWhen you place a shape into the svg area, you can specify where it goes with x and y coordinates. The origin point of (0, 0) is in the upper-left corner. Positive values for x push the shape to the right, and positive values for y push the shape down from the origin point.\nTo place a shape in the middle of the 500 (width) x 100 (height) svg from last challenge, the x coordinate would be 250 and the y coordinate would be 50.\nAn SVG rect has four attributes.

The last challenge set them each to 0, so every bar was placed in the upper-left corner.\nFor a bar chart, all of the bars should sit on the same vertical level, which means the y value stays the same (at 0) for all bars. The x value, however, needs to change as you add new bars. Remember that larger x values push items farther to the right. As you go through the array elements in dataset, the x value should increase.\nThe attr() method in D3 accepts a callback function to dynamically set that attribute.

This is because of how SVG uses (x, y) coordinates.\nIn SVG, the origin point for the coordinates is in the upper-left corner. An x coordinate of 0 places a shape on the left edge of the SVG area. A y coordinate of 0 places a shape on the top edge of the SVG area. Higher x values push the rectangle to the right. Higher y values push the rectangle down.\nTo make the bars right-side-up, you need to change the way the y coordinate is calculated. It needs to account for both the height of the bar and the total height of the SVG area.\nThe height of the SVG area is 100. If you have a data point of 0 in the set, you would want the bar to start at the bottom of the SVG area (not the top). To do this, the y coordinate needs a value of 100.

However, if the height of a bar or one of the data points were larger than the SVG height or width values, it would go outside the SVG area.\nIn D3, there are scales to help plot data. Scales are functions that tell the program how to map a set of raw data points onto the pixels of the SVG canvas.\nFor example, say you have a 100x500-sized SVG canvas and you want to plot Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for a number of countries. The set of numbers would be in the billion or trillion-dollar range.

Before plotting it, you set the scale for your entire data set, so that the x and y values fit your canvas width and height.\nD3 has several scale types.

This is the input information for a scale, and is also known as the domain.\nYou want to map those points along the x axis on the SVG canvas, between 10 units and 500 units. This is the output information, which is also known as the range.\nThe domain() and range() methods set these values for the scale. Both methods take an array of at least two elements as an argument. Here's an example:\n// Set a domain\n// The domain covers the set of input values\nscale.domain([50, 480]);\n// Set a range\n// The range covers the set of output values\nscale.range([10, 500]);\nscale(50) // Returns 10\nscale(480) // Returns 500\nscale(325) // Returns 323.37\nscale(750) // Returns 807.67\nd3.scaleLinear()\nNotice that the scale uses the linear relationship between the domain and range values to figure out what the output should be for a given number. The minimum value in the domain (50) maps to the minimum value (10) in the range.\nCreate a scale and set its domain to [250, 500] and range to [10, 150].\nNote\nYou can chain the domain() and range() methods onto the scale variable.\n\n  \n    // Add your code below this line\n    const scale = d3.scaleLinear();\n    scale.domain([250,500]);\n    scale.range([10,150]);\n\n\n    // Add your code above this line\n    const output = scale(50);\n    d3.select(\"body\")\n      .append(\"h2\")\n      .text(output);\n  \n\n"},"data-visualization-certification/data-visualization-with-d3/data-visualization-with-d3-use-the-d3max-and-d3min-functions-to-find-minimum-and-maximum-values-in-a-dataset.html":{"url":"data-visualization-certification/data-visualization-with-d3/data-visualization-with-d3-use-the-d3max-and-d3min-functions-to-find-minimum-and-maximum-values-in-a-dataset.html","title":"Data Visualization with D3: Use the d3.max and d3.min Functions to Find Minimum and Maximum Values in a Dataset","keywords":"","body":"Data Visualization with D3: Use the d3.max and d3.min Functions to Find Minimum and Maximum Values in a Dataset\nThe D3 methods domain() and range() set that information for your scale based on the data. There are a couple methods to make that easier.\nOften when you set the domain, you'll want to use the minimum and maximum values within the data set. Trying to find these values manually, especially in a large data set, may cause errors.\nD3 has two methods - min() and max() to return this information. Here's an example:\nconst exampleData = [34, 234, 73, 90, 6, 52];\nd3.min(exampleData) // Returns 6\nd3.max(exampleData) // Returns 234\nA dataset may have nested arrays, like the [x, y] coordinate pairs that were in the scatter plot example. In that case, you need to tell D3 how to calculate the maximum and minimum.\nFortunately, both the min() and max() methods take a callback function.\nIn this example, the callback function's argument d is for the current inner array. The callback needs to return the element from the inner array (the x or y value) over which you want to compute the maximum or minimum. Here's an example for how to find the min and max values with an array of arrays:\nconst locationData = [[1, 7],[6, 3],[8, 3]];\n// Returns the smallest number out of the first elements\nconst minX = d3.min(locationData, (d) => d[0]);\n// minX compared 1, 6, and 8 and is set to 1\nThe positionData variable holds a 3-dimensional (3D) array. Use a D3 method to find the maximum value of the z coordinate (the third value) from the arrays and save it in the output variable.\nNote\nFun fact - D3 can plot 3D arrays.\n\n  \n    const positionData = [[1, 7, -4],[6, 3, 8],[2, 8, 3]]\n    // Add your code below this line\n    const max = d3.max(positionData, (d) => d[2])\n    const output = max; // Change this line\n\n    // Add your code above this line\n\n    d3.select(\"body\")\n      .append(\"h2\")\n      .text(output)\n  \n\n"},"data-visualization-certification/data-visualization-with-d3/data-visualization-with-d3-use-dynamic-scales.html":{"url":"data-visualization-certification/data-visualization-with-d3/data-visualization-with-d3-use-dynamic-scales.html","title":"Data Visualization with D3: Use Dynamic Scales","keywords":"","body":"Data Visualization with D3: Use Dynamic Scales\nThe D3 min() and max() methods are useful to help set the scale.\nGiven a complex data set, one priority is to set the scale so the visualization fits the SVG container's width and height. You want all the data plotted inside the SVG canvas so it's visible on the web page.\nThe example below sets the x-axis scale for scatter plot data. The domain() method passes information to the scale about the raw data values for the plot. The range() method gives it information about the actual space on the web page for the visualization.\nIn the example, the domain goes from 0 to the maximum in the set. It uses the max() method with a callback function based on the x values in the arrays. The range uses the SVG canvas' width (w), but it includes some padding, too. This puts space between the scatter plot dots and the edge of the SVG canvas.\nconst dataset = [\n  [ 34, 78 ],\n  [ 109, 280 ],\n  [ 310, 120 ],\n  [ 79, 411 ],\n  [ 420, 220 ],\n  [ 233, 145 ],\n  [ 333, 96 ],\n  [ 222, 333 ],\n  [ 78, 320 ],\n  [ 21, 123 ]\n];\nconst w = 500;\nconst h = 500;\n// Padding between the SVG canvas boundary and the plot\nconst padding = 30;\nconst xScale = d3.scaleLinear()\n  .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, (d) => d[0])])\n  .range([padding, w - padding]);\nThe padding may be confusing at first. Picture the x-axis as a horizontal line from 0 to 500 (the width value for the SVG canvas). Including the padding in the range() method forces the plot to start at 30 along that line (instead of 0), and end at 470 (instead of 500).\nUse the yScale variable to create a linear y-axis scale. The domain should start at zero and go to the maximum y value in the set. The range should use the SVG height (h) and include padding.\nNote\nRemember to keep the plot right-side-up. When you set the range for the y coordinates, the higher value (height minus padding) is the first argument, and the lower value is the second argument.\n\n  \n    const dataset = [\n                  [ 34,    78 ],\n                  [ 109,   280 ],\n                  [ 310,   120 ],\n                  [ 79,    411 ],\n                  [ 420,   220 ],\n                  [ 233,   145 ],\n                  [ 333,   96 ],\n                  [ 222,   333 ],\n                  [ 78,    320 ],\n                  [ 21,    123 ]\n                ];\n\n    const w = 500;\n    const h = 500;\n\n    // Padding between the SVG canvas boundary and the plot\n    const padding = 30;\n\n    // Create an x and y scale\n\n    const xScale = d3.scaleLinear()\n                    .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, (d) => d[0])])\n                    .range([padding, w - padding]);\n\n    // Add your code below this line\n\n    const yScale = d3.scaleLinear()\n                  .domain([0,d3.max(dataset,(d) => d[1])])\n                  .range([h - padding, padding]);\n\n\n    // Add your code above this line\n\n    const output = yScale(411); // Returns 30\n    d3.select(\"body\")\n      .append(\"h2\")\n      .text(output)\n  \n\n"},"data-visualization-certification/data-visualization-with-d3/data-visualization-with-d3-use-a-pre-defined-scale-to-place-elements.html":{"url":"data-visualization-certification/data-visualization-with-d3/data-visualization-with-d3-use-a-pre-defined-scale-to-place-elements.html","title":"Data Visualization with D3: Use a Pre-Defined Scale to Place Elements","keywords":"","body":"Data Visualization with D3: Use a Pre-Defined Scale to Place Elements\nWith the scales set up, it's time to map the scatter plot again. The scales are like processing functions that turn the x and y raw data into values that fit and render correctly on the SVG canvas. They keep the data within the screen's plotting area.\nYou set the coordinate attribute values for an SVG shape with the scaling function. This includes x and y attributes for rect or text elements, or cx and cy for circles. Here's an example:\nshape\n  .attr(\"x\", (d) => xScale(d[0]))\nScales set shape coordinate attributes to place the data points onto the SVG canvas. You don't need to apply scales when you display the actual data value, for example, in the text() method for a tooltip or label.\nUse xScale and yScale to position both the circle and text shapes onto the SVG canvas. For the circles, apply the scales to set the cx and cy attributes. Give them a radius of 5 units, too.\nFor the text elements, apply the scales to set the x and y attributes. The labels should be offset to the right of the dots. To do this, add 10 units to the x data value before passing it to the xScale.\n\n  \n    const dataset = [\n                  [ 34,     78 ],\n                  [ 109,   280 ],\n                  [ 310,   120 ],\n                  [ 79,   411 ],\n                  [ 420,   220 ],\n                  [ 233,   145 ],\n                  [ 333,   96 ],\n                  [ 222,    333 ],\n                  [ 78,    320 ],\n                  [ 21,   123 ]\n                ];\n\n    const w = 500;\n    const h = 500;\n    const padding = 60;\n\n    const xScale = d3.scaleLinear()\n                     .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, (d) => d[0])])\n                     .range([padding, w - padding]);\n\n    const yScale = d3.scaleLinear()\n                     .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, (d) => d[1])])\n                     .range([h - padding, padding]);\n\n    const svg = d3.select(\"body\")\n                  .append(\"svg\")\n                  .attr(\"width\", w)\n                  .attr(\"height\", h);\n\n    svg.selectAll(\"circle\")\n       .data(dataset)\n       .enter()\n       .append(\"circle\")\n       // Add your code below this line\n       .attr(\"cx\",(d) => xScale(d[0]))\n       .attr(\"cy\",(d) => yScale(d[1]))\n       .attr(\"r\",\"5\")\n\n\n       // Add your code above this line\n\n    svg.selectAll(\"text\")\n       .data(dataset)\n       .enter()\n       .append(\"text\")\n       .text((d) =>  (d[0] + \", \"\n + d[1]))\n       // Add your code below this line\n       .attr(\"x\",(d) => xScale(d[0]+10))\n       .attr(\"y\",(d) => yScale(d[1]))\n\n\n       // Add your code above this line\n  \n\n"},"data-visualization-certification/data-visualization-with-d3/data-visualization-with-d3-add-axes-to-a-visualization.html":{"url":"data-visualization-certification/data-visualization-with-d3/data-visualization-with-d3-add-axes-to-a-visualization.html","title":"Data Visualization with D3: Add Axes to a Visualization","keywords":"","body":"Data Visualization with D3: Add Axes to a Visualization\nAnother way to improve the scatter plot is to add an x-axis and a y-axis.\nD3 has two methods axisLeft() and axisBottom() to render the y and x axes, respectively. (Axes is the plural form of axis). Here's an example to create the x-axis based on the xScale in the previous challenges:\nconst xAxis = d3.axisBottom(xScale);\nThe next step is to render the axis on the SVG canvas. To do so, you can use a general SVG component, the g element. The g stands for group.\nUnlike rect, circle, and text, an axis is just a straight line when it's rendered. Because it is a simple shape, using g works.\nThe last step is to apply a transform attribute to position the axis on the SVG canvas in the right place. Otherwise, the line would render along the border of SVG canvas and wouldn't be visible.\nSVG supports different types of transforms, but positioning an axis needs translate. When it's applied to the g element, it moves the whole group over and down by the given amounts. Here's an example:\nconst xAxis = d3.axisBottom(xScale);\nsvg.append(\"g\")\n   .attr(\"transform\", \"translate(0, \" + (h - padding) + \")\")\n   .call(xAxis);\nThe above code places the x-axis at the bottom of the SVG canvas. Then it's passed as an argument to the call() method.\nThe y-axis works is the same way, except the translate argument is in the form (x, 0). Because translate is a string in the attr() method above, you can use concatenation to include variable values for its arguments.\nThe scatter plot now has an x-axis. Create a y-axis in a variable named yAxis using the axisLeft() method. Then render the axis using a g element. Make sure to use a transform attribute to translate the axis by the amount of padding units right, and 0 units down. Remember to call() the axis.\n\n  \n    const dataset = [\n                  [ 34,     78 ],\n                  [ 109,   280 ],\n                  [ 310,   120 ],\n                  [ 79,   411 ],\n                  [ 420,   220 ],\n                  [ 233,   145 ],\n                  [ 333,   96 ],\n                  [ 222,    333 ],\n                  [ 78,    320 ],\n                  [ 21,   123 ]\n                ];\n\n    const w = 500;\n    const h = 500;\n    const padding = 60;\n\n    const xScale = d3.scaleLinear()\n                     .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, (d) => d[0])])\n                     .range([padding, w - padding]);\n\n    const yScale = d3.scaleLinear()\n                     .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, (d) => d[1])])\n                     .range([h - padding, padding]);\n\n    const svg = d3.select(\"body\")\n                  .append(\"svg\")\n                  .attr(\"width\", w)\n                  .attr(\"height\", h);\n\n    svg.selectAll(\"circle\")\n       .data(dataset)\n       .enter()\n       .append(\"circle\")\n       .attr(\"cx\", (d) => xScale(d[0]))\n       .attr(\"cy\",(d) => yScale(d[1]))\n       .attr(\"r\", (d) => 5);\n\n    svg.selectAll(\"text\")\n       .data(dataset)\n       .enter()\n       .append(\"text\")\n       .text((d) =>  (d[0] + \",\" + d[1]))\n       .attr(\"x\", (d) => xScale(d[0] + 10))\n       .attr(\"y\", (d) => yScale(d[1]))\n\n    const xAxis = d3.axisBottom(xScale);\n    // Add your code below this line\n    const yAxis = d3.axisLeft(yScale);\n    // Add your code above this line\n\n    svg.append(\"g\")\n       .attr(\"transform\", \"translate(0,\" + (h - padding) + \")\")\n       .call(xAxis);\n\n    // Add your code below this line\n    svg.append(\"g\")\n       .attr(\"transform\",\"translate(\" + padding + \", 0)\")\n       .call(yAxis);\n\n\n    // Add your code above this line\n\n  \n\n"},"data-visualization-certification/introduction-to-the-json-apis-and-ajax-challenges.html":{"url":"data-visualization-certification/introduction-to-the-json-apis-and-ajax-challenges.html","title":"Introduction to the JSON APIs and AJAX Challenges","keywords":"","body":"Introduction to the JSON APIs and AJAX Challenges\nSimilar to how User Interfaces help people use programs, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) help programs interact with other programs. APIs are tools that computers use to communicate with one another, in part to send and receive data. You can use API functionality in your page once you understand how to make requests and process data from it. Programmers often use AJAX technologies when working with APIs.\nThe term AJAX originated as an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It refers to a group of technologies that make asynchronous requests to a server to transfer data, then load any returned data into the page. An asynchronous process has a couple key properties. The browser does not stop loading a page to wait for the server's response. Also, the browser inserts updated data into part of the page without having to refresh the entire page.\nUser experience benefits from asynchronous processes in several ways. Pages load faster since the browser isn't waiting for the server to respond in the middle of a page render. Requests and transfers happen in the background, without interrupting what the user is doing. When the browser receives new data, only the necessary area of the page refreshes. These qualities especially enhance the user experience for single page applications.\nThe data transferred between the browser and server is often in a format called JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). JSON resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, except that it's transferred as a string. Once received, it can be converted into an object and used in a script.\nThis section covers how to transfer and use data using AJAX technologies with a freeCodeCamp API.\n"},"data-visualization-certification/introduction-to-the-json-apis-and-ajax-challenges/json-apis-and-ajax-handle-click-events-with-javascript-using-the-onclick-property.html":{"url":"data-visualization-certification/introduction-to-the-json-apis-and-ajax-challenges/json-apis-and-ajax-handle-click-events-with-javascript-using-the-onclick-property.html","title":"JSON APIs and Ajax: Handle Click Events with JavaScript using the onclick property","keywords":"","body":"JSON APIs and Ajax: Handle Click Events with JavaScript using the onclick property\nYou want your code to execute only once your page has finished loading.

You'll learn how to update HTML with the data we get from APIs using a technology called AJAX.\nMost web APIs transfer data in a format called JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.\nJSON syntax looks very similar to JavaScript object literal notation. JSON has object properties and their current values, sandwiched between a { and a }.\nThese properties and their values are often referred to as \"key-value pairs\".\nHowever, JSON transmitted by APIs are sent as bytes, and your application receives it as a string. These can be converted into JavaScript objects, but they are not JavaScript objects by default. The JSON.parse method parses the string and constructs the JavaScript object described by it.\nYou can request the JSON from freeCodeCamp's Cat Photo API. Here's the code you can put in your click event to do this:\nreq=new XMLHttpRequest();\nreq.open(\"GET\",'/json/cats.json',true);\nreq.send();\nreq.onload=function(){\n  json=JSON.parse(req.responseText);\n  document.getElementsByClassName('message')[0].innerHTML=JSON.stringify(json);\n};\nHere's a review of what each piece is doing. The JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object has a number of properties and methods that are used to transfer data. First, an instance of the XMLHttpRequest object is created and saved in the req variable.\nNext, the open method initializes a request - this example is requesting data from an API, therefore is a \"GET\" request. The second argument for open is the URL of the API you are requesting data from. The third argument is a Boolean value where true makes it an asynchronous request.\nThe send method sends the request.

Recall some notation in JavaScript:\n[ ] -> Square brackets represent an array\n{ } -> Curly brackets represent an object\n\" \" -> Double quotes represent a string. They are also used for key names in JSON\nUnderstanding the structure of the data that an API returns is important because it influences how you retrieve the values you need.\nOn the right, click the \"Get Message\" button to load the freeCodeCamp Cat Photo API JSON into the HTML.\nThe first and last character you see in the JSON data are square brackets [ ]. This means that the returned data is an array. The second character in the JSON data is a curly { bracket, which starts an object. Looking closely, you can see that there are three separate objects. The JSON data is an array of three objects, where each object contains information about a cat photo.\nYou learned earlier that objects contain \"key-value pairs\" that are separated by commas. In the Cat Photo example, the first object has \"id\":0 where \"id\" is a key and 0 is its corresponding value. Similarly, there are keys for \"imageLink\", \"altText\", and \"codeNames\". Each cat photo object has these same keys, but with different values.\nAnother interesting \"key-value pair\" in the first object is \"codeNames\":[\"Juggernaut\",\"Mrs. Wallace\",\"ButterCup\"]. Here \"codeNames\" is the key and its value is an array of three strings. It's possible to have arrays of objects as well as a key with an array as a value.\nRemember how to access data in arrays and objects. Arrays use bracket notation to access a specific index of an item. Objects use either bracket or dot notation to access the value of a given property. Here's an example that prints the \"altText\" of the first cat photo - note that the parsed JSON data in the editor is saved in a variable called json:\nconsole.log(json[0].altText);\n// Prints \"A white cat wearing a green helmet shaped melon on its head.\"\nFor the cat with the \"id\" of 2, print to the console the second value in the codeNames array. You should use bracket and dot notation on the object (which is saved in the variable json) to access the value.\n\n  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){\n    document.getElementById('getMessage').onclick=function(){\n      req=new XMLHttpRequest();\n      req.open(\"GET\",'/json/cats.json',true);\n      req.send();\n      req.onload=function(){\n        json=JSON.parse(req.responseText);\n        document.getElementsByClassName('message')[0].innerHTML=JSON.stringify(json);\n        // Add your code below this line\n        console.log(json[2].codeNames[1]);\n\n        // Add your code above this line\n      };\n    };\n  });\n\n\n  body {\n    text-align: center;\n    font-family: \"Helvetica\", sans-serif;\n  }\n  h1 {\n    font-size: 2em;\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n  .box {\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    background-color: #eee;\n    padding: 20px 5px;\n  }\n  button {\n    color: white;\n    background-color: #4791d0;\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    border: 1px solid #4791d0;\n    padding: 5px 10px 8px 10px;\n  }\n  button:hover {\n    background-color: #0F5897;\n    border: 1px solid #0F5897;\n  }\n\nCat Photo Finder \n\n  The message will go here\n\n\n  \n    Get Message\n  \n\n"},"data-visualization-certification/introduction-to-the-json-apis-and-ajax-challenges/json-apis-and-ajax-convert-json-data-to-html.html":{"url":"data-visualization-certification/introduction-to-the-json-apis-and-ajax-challenges/json-apis-and-ajax-convert-json-data-to-html.html","title":"JSON APIs and Ajax: Convert JSON Data to HTML","keywords":"","body":"JSON APIs and Ajax: Convert JSON Data to HTML\nNow that you're getting data from a JSON API, you can display it in the HTML.\nYou can use a forEach method to loop through the data since the cat photo objects are held in an array.

access your user's current location.

The challenge can be completed either way, as long as the code is correct.\nBy selecting allow, you will see the text on the output phone change to your latitude and longitude.\nHere's code that does this:\nif (navigator.geolocation){\n  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {\n    document.getElementById('data').innerHTML=\"latitude: \"+ position.coords.latitude + \"longitude: \" + position.coords.longitude;\n  });\n}\nFirst, it checks if the navigator.geolocation object exists.

If the request is successful, the callback function in the method runs.

You can also send data to an external resource, as long as that resource supports AJAX requests and you know the URL.\nJavaScript's XMLHttpRequest method is also used to post data to a server. Here's an example:\nreq=new XMLHttpRequest();\nreq.open(\"POST\",url,true);\nreq.setRequestHeader('Content-Type','text/plain');\nreq.onreadystatechange=function(){\n  if(req.readyState==4 && req.status==200){\n    document.getElementsByClassName('message')[0].innerHTML=req.responseText;\n  }\n};\nreq.send(userName);\nYou've seen several of these methods before. Here the open method initializes the request as a \"POST\" to the given URL of the external resource, and uses the true Boolean to make it asynchronous.\nThe setRequestHeader method sets the value of an HTTP request header, which contains information about the sender and the request. It must be called after the open method, but before the send method. The two parameters are the name of the header and the value to set as the body of that header.\nNext, the onreadystatechange event listener handles a change in the state of the request. A readyState of 4 means the operation is complete, and a status of 200 means it was a successful request.
