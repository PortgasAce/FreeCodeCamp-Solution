Challenges\nReact, popularized by Facebook, is a open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. With JSX, it is used to create components, handle state and props, utilize event listeners and certain life cycle methods to update data as it changes.\nReact combines HTML with JavaScript functionality to create its own markup language, JSX. This section will introduce you to all of these concepts and how to implement them for use with your own projects.\n"},"react-pass-state-as-props-to-child-components.html":{"url":"react-pass-state-as-props-to-child-components.html","title":"React: Pass State as Props to Child Components","keywords":"","body":"React: Pass State as Props to Child Components\nYou saw a lot of examples that passed props to child JSX elements and child React components in previous challenges. You may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the state important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that state, which are passed in as props.\nFor example, maybe you have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components. In your App, you have state that contains a lot of user information, but the Navbar only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of state to the Navbar component as a prop.\nThis pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is unidirectional data flow. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.\nThe MyApp component is stateful and renders a Navbar component as a child. Pass the name property in its state down to the child component, then show the name in the h1 tag that's part of the Navbar render method.\nclass MyApp extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      name: 'CamperBot'\n    }\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n       \n         \n       \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nclass Navbar extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n    \n      Hello, my name is: {this.props.name} \n    \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-pass-a-callback-as-props.html":{"url":"react-pass-a-callback-as-props.html","title":"React: Pass a Callback as Props","keywords":"","body":"React: Pass a Callback as Props\nYou can pass state as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under this.props in the child component.\nThere are three components outlined in the code editor. The MyApp component is the parent that will render the GetInput and RenderInput child components. Add the GetInput component to the render method in MyApp, then pass it a prop called input assigned to inputValue from MyApp's state. Also create a prop called handleChange and pass the input handler handleChange to it.\nNext, add RenderInput to the render method in MyApp, then create a prop called input and pass the inputValue from state to it. Once you are finished you will be able to type in the input field in the GetInput component, which then calls the handler method in its parent via props. This updates the input in the state of the parent, which is passed as props to both children. Observe how the data flows between the components and how the single source of truth remains the state of the parent component. Admittedly, this example is a bit contrived, but should serve to illustrate how data and callbacks can be passed between React components.\nclass MyApp extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      inputValue: ''\n    }\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleChange(event) {\n    this.setState({\n      inputValue: event.target.value\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n       \n        { /* change code below this line */ }\n        \n        \n        { /* change code above this line */ }\n       \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nclass GetInput extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Get Input:\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nclass RenderInput extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Input Render:\n        {this.props.input}\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-the-lifecycle-method-componentwillmount.html":{"url":"react-use-the-lifecycle-method-componentwillmount.html","title":"React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount","keywords":"","body":"React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount\nReact components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. These are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks, and allow you to catch components at certain points in time. This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods:\ncomponentWillMount()\ncomponentDidMount()\ncomponentWillReceiveProps()\nshouldComponentUpdate()\ncomponentWillUpdate()\ncomponentDidUpdate()\ncomponentWillUnmount()\nThe next several lessons will cover some of the basic use cases for these lifecycle methods.\nThe componentWillMount() method is called before the render() method when a component is being mounted to the DOM. Log something to the console within componentWillMount() - you may want to have your browser console open to see the output.\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  componentWillMount() {\n    // change code below this line\n    console.log(\"componentWillMount\")\n    // change code above this line\n  }\n  render() {\n    return \n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-the-lifecycle-method-componentdidmount.html":{"url":"react-use-the-lifecycle-method-componentdidmount.html","title":"React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount","keywords":"","body":"React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount\nMost web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.\nThe best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method componentDidMount(). This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to setState() here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.\nThere is a mock API call in componentDidMount(). It sets state after 2.5 seconds to simulate calling a server to retrieve data. This example requests the current total active users for a site. In the render method, render the value of activeUsers in the h1. Watch what happens in the preview, and feel free to change the timeout to see the different effects.\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      activeUsers: null\n    };\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    setTimeout( () => {\n      this.setState({\n        activeUsers: 1273\n      });\n    }, 2500);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Active Users: { this.state.activeUsers }\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-add-event-listeners.html":{"url":"react-add-event-listeners.html","title":"React: Add Event Listeners","keywords":"","body":"React: Add Event Listeners\nThe componentDidMount() method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality. React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.\nYou've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as onClick(). React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.\nAttach an event listener in the componentDidMount() method for keydown events and have these events trigger the callback handleKeyPress(). You can use document.addEventListener() which takes the event (in quotes) as the first argument and the callback as the second argument.\nThen, in componentWillUnmount(), remove this same event listener. You can pass the same arguments to document.removeEventListener(). It's good practice to use this lifecycle method to do any clean up on React components before they are unmounted and destroyed. Removing event listeners is an example of one such clean up action.\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      message: ''\n    };\n    this.handleEnter = this.handleEnter.bind(this);\n    this.handleKeyPress = this.handleKeyPress.bind(this);\n  }\n  // change code below this line\n  componentDidMount() {\n     document.addEventListener(\"keydown\",this.handleKeyPress);\n  }\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    document.removeEventListener(\"keydown\",this.handleKeyPress);\n  }\n  // change code above this line\n  handleEnter() {\n    this.setState({\n      message: this.state.message + 'You pressed the enter key! '\n    });\n  }\n  handleKeyPress(event) {\n    if (event.keyCode === 13) {\n      this.handleEnter();\n    }\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.state.message}\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-manage-updates-with-lifecycle-methods.html":{"url":"react-manage-updates-with-lifecycle-methods.html","title":"React: Manage Updates with Lifecycle Methods","keywords":"","body":"React: Manage Updates with Lifecycle Methods\nAnother lifecycle method is componentWillReceiveProps() which is called whenever a component is receiving new props. This method receives the new props as an argument, which is usually written as nextProps. You can use this argument and compare with this.props and perform actions before the component updates. For example, you may call setState() locally before the update is processed.\nAnother method is componentDidUpdate(), and is called immediately after a component re-renders. Note that rendering and mounting are considered different things in the component lifecycle. When a page first loads, all components are mounted and this is where methods like componentWillMount() and componentDidMount() are called. After this, as state changes, components re-render themselves. The next challenge covers this in more detail.\nThe child component Dialog receives message props from its parent, the Controller component. Write the componentWillReceiveProps() method in the Dialog component and have it log this.props and nextProps to the console. You'll need to pass nextProps as an argument to this method and although it's possible to name it anything, name it nextProps here.\nNext, add componentDidUpdate() in the Dialog component, and log a statement that says the component has updated. This method works similar to componentWillUpdate(), which is provided for you. Now click the button to change the message and watch your browser console. The order of the console statements show the order the methods are called.\nNote: You'll need to write the lifecycle methods as normal functions and not as arrow functions to pass the tests (there is also no advantage to writing lifecycle methods as arrow functions).\nclass Dialog extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  componentWillUpdate() {\n    console.log('Component is about to update...');\n  }\n  // change code below this line\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps){\n    console.log('Component will receive props: '+this.props.message+\",next: \"+nextProps.message)\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate(){\n    console.log('Component will receive props: '+this.props.message)\n  }\n\n  // change code above this line\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.message}\n  }\n};\n\nclass Controller extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      message: 'First Message'\n    };\n    this.changeMessage = this.changeMessage.bind(this);\n  }\n  changeMessage() {\n    this.setState({\n      message: 'Second Message'\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Update\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-optimize-re-renders-with-shouldcomponentupdate.html":{"url":"react-optimize-re-renders-with-shouldcomponentupdate.html","title":"React: Optimize Re-Renders with shouldComponentUpdate","keywords":"","body":"React: Optimize Re-Renders with shouldComponentUpdate\nSo far, if any component receives new state or new props, it re-renders itself and all its children. This is usually okay. But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new state or props, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. The method is shouldComponentUpdate(), and it takes nextProps and nextState as parameters.\nThis method is a useful way to optimize performance. For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new props, even if the props haven't changed. You can use shouldComponentUpdate() to prevent this by comparing the props. The method must return a boolean value that tells React whether or not to update the component. You can compare the current props (this.props) to the next props (nextProps) to determine if you need to update or not, and return true or false accordingly.\nThe shouldComponentUpdate() method is added in a component called OnlyEvens. Currently, this method returns true so OnlyEvens re-renders every time it receives new props. Modify the method so OnlyEvens updates only if the value of its new props is even. Click the Add button and watch the order of events in your browser's console as the other lifecycle hooks are triggered.\nclass OnlyEvens extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n    console.log('Should I update?');\n     // change code below this line\n    return nextProps.value%2 !== 1;\n     // change code above this line\n  }\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    console.log('Receiving new props...');\n  }\n  componentDidUpdate() {\n    console.log('Component re-rendered.');\n  }\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.value}\n  }\n};\n\nclass Controller extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      value: 0\n    };\n    this.addValue = this.addValue.bind(this);\n  }\n  addValue() {\n    this.setState({\n      value: this.state.value + 1\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Add\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-introducing-inline-styles.html":{"url":"react-introducing-inline-styles.html","title":"React: Introducing Inline Styles","keywords":"","body":"React: Introducing Inline Styles\nThere are other complex concepts that add powerful capabilities to your React code. But you may be wondering about the more simple problem of how to style those JSX elements you create in React. You likely know that it won't be exactly the same as working with HTML because of the way you apply classes to JSX elements.\nIf you import styles from a stylesheet, it isn't much different at all. You apply a class to your JSX element using the className attribute, and apply styles to the class in your stylesheet. Another option is to apply inline styles, which are very common in ReactJS development.\nYou apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. Here's an example of an inline style in HTML:\nMellow Yellow\nJSX elements use the style attribute, but because of the way JSX is transpiled, you can't set the value to a string. Instead, you set it equal to a JavaScript object. Here's an example:\nMellow Yellow\nNotice how we camelCase the \"fontSize\" property? This is because React will not accept kebab-case keys in the style object. React will apply the correct property name for us in the HTML.\nAdd a style attribute to the div in the code editor to give the text a color of red and font size of 72px.\nNote that you can optionally set the font size to be a number, omitting the units \"px\", or write it as \"72px\".\nclass Colorful extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      Big Red\n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-add-inline-styles-in-react.html":{"url":"react-add-inline-styles-in-react.html","title":"React: Add Inline Styles in React","keywords":"","body":"React: Add Inline Styles in React\nYou may have noticed in the last challenge that there were several other syntax differences from HTML inline styles in addition to the style attribute set to a JavaScript object. First, the names of certain CSS style properties use camel case. For example, the last challenge set the size of the font with fontSize instead of font-size. Hyphenated words like font-size are invalid syntax for JavaScript object properties, so React uses camel case. As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX.\nAll property value length units (like height, width, and fontSize) are assumed to be in px unless otherwise specified. If you want to use em, for example, you wrap the value and the units in quotes, like {fontSize: \"4em\"}. Other than the length values that default to px, all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.\nIf you have a large set of styles, you can assign a style object to a constant to keep your code organized. Uncomment the styles constant and declare an object with three style properties and their values. Give the div a color of \"purple\", a font-size of 40, and a border of \"2px solid purple\". Then set the style attribute equal to the styles constant.\nconst styles ={\"color\":\"purple\",\"fontSize\":40,\"border\":\"2px solid purple\"};\n// change code above this line\nclass Colorful extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    // change code below this line\n    return (\n      Style Me!\n    );\n    // change code above this line\n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-advanced-javascript-in-react-render-method.html":{"url":"react-use-advanced-javascript-in-react-render-method.html","title":"React: Use Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method","keywords":"","body":"React: Use Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method\nIn previous challenges, you learned how to inject JavaScript code into JSX code using curly braces, { }, for tasks like accessing props, passing props, accessing state, inserting comments into your code, and most recently, styling your components. These are all common use cases to put JavaScript in JSX, but they aren't the only way that you can utilize JavaScript code in your React components.\nYou can also write JavaScript directly in your render methods, before the return statement, without inserting it inside of curly braces. This is because it is not yet within the JSX code. When you want to use a variable later in the JSX code inside the return statement, you place the variable name inside curly braces.\nIn the code provided, the render method has an array that contains 20 phrases to represent the answers found in the classic 1980's Magic Eight Ball toy. The button click event is bound to the ask method, so each time the button is clicked a random number will be generated and stored as the randomIndex in state.

The button toggles the state of this value. Currently, it renders the same UI every time.

Otherwise, return the markup without the h1 element.\nNote: You must write an if/else to pass the tests.

Imagine that you are tracking several conditions in a component and you want different elements to render depending on each of these conditions. If you write a lot of else if statements to return slightly different UIs, you may repeat code which leaves room for error. Instead, you can use the && logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is true, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:\n{condition && markup}\nIf the condition is true, the markup will be returned. If the condition is false, the operation will immediately return false after evaluating the condition and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing && after each one. This allows you to handle more complex conditional logic in your render() method without repeating a lot of code.\nSolve the previous example again, so the h1 only renders if display is true, but use the && logical operator instead of an if/else statement.\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      display: true\n    }\n    this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);\n  }\n  toggleDisplay() {\n    this.setState({\n      display: !this.state.display\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    // change code below this line\n    return (\n       \n         Toggle Display\n         {this.state.display && Displayed!}\n       \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-a-ternary-expression-for-conditional-rendering.html":{"url":"react-use-a-ternary-expression-for-conditional-rendering.html","title":"React: Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering","keywords":"","body":"React: Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering\nBefore moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the ternary operator. The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for if/else statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional if/else statements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, if/else statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago — when an if/else statement was required, it was always outside the return statement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:\ncondition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse\nThe code editor has three constants defined within the CheckUserAge component's render() method. They are called buttonOne, buttonTwo, and buttonThree. Each of these is assigned a simple JSX expression representing a button element. First, initialize the state of CheckUserAge with input and userAge both set to values of an empty string.\nOnce the component is rendering information to the page, users should have a way to interact with it. Within the component's return statement, set up a ternary expression that implements the following logic: when the page first loads, render the submit button, buttonOne, to the page. Then, when a user enters their age and clicks the button, render a different button based on the age. If a user enters a number less than 18, render buttonThree.

However, there's one important topic left to discuss that lets you combine any or all of these concepts with another powerful React feature: props. Using props to conditionally render code is very common with React developers — that is, they use the value of a given prop to automatically make decisions about what to render.\nIn this challenge, you'll set up a child component to make rendering decisions based on props. You'll also use the ternary operator, but you can see how several of the other concepts that were covered in the last few challenges might be just as useful in this context.\nThe code editor has two components that are partially defined for you: a parent called GameOfChance, and a child called Results. They are used to create a simple game where the user presses a button to see if they win or lose.\nFirst, you'll need a simple expression that randomly returns a different value every time it is run. You can use Math.random(). This method returns a value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) each time it is called. So for 50/50 odds, use Math.random() > .5 in your expression. Statistically speaking, this expression will return true 50% of the time, and false the other 50%. On line 30, replace the comment with this expression to complete the variable declaration.\nNow you have an expression that you can use to make a randomized decision in the code. Next you need to implement this. Render the Results component as a child of GameOfChance, and pass in expression as a prop called fiftyFifty. In the Results component, write a ternary expression to render the text \"You win!\" or \"You lose!\" based on the fiftyFifty prop that's being passed in from GameOfChance. Finally, make sure the handleClick() method is correctly counting each turn so the user knows how many times they've played. This also serves to let the user know the component has actually updated in case they win or lose twice in a row.\nclass Results extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n      {\n        this.props.fiftyFifty ? \"You win!\":\"You lose!\"\n        /* change code here */\n      }\n      \n    )\n  };\n};\n\nclass GameOfChance extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      counter: 1\n    }\n    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleClick() {\n    this.setState({\n      counter: ++this.state.counter // change code here\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    let expression = Math.random() > .5; // change code here\n    return (\n      \n        Play Again\n        { /* change code below this line */ }\n        \n        { /* change code above this line */ }\n        {'Turn: ' + this.state.counter}\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-change-inline-css-conditionally-based-on-component-state.html":{"url":"react-change-inline-css-conditionally-based-on-component-state.html","title":"React: Change Inline CSS Conditionally Based on Component State","keywords":"","body":"React: Change Inline CSS Conditionally Based on Component State\nAt this point, you've seen several applications of conditional rendering and the use of inline styles. Here's one more example that combines both of these topics. You can also render CSS conditionally based on the state of a React component. To do this, you check for a condition, and if that condition is met, you modify the styles object that's assigned to the JSX elements in the render method.\nThis paradigm is important to understand because it is a dramatic shift from the more traditional approach of applying styles by modifying DOM elements directly (which is very common with jQuery, for example). In that approach, you must keep track of when elements change and also handle the actual manipulation directly. It can become difficult to keep track of changes, potentially making your UI unpredictable. When you set a style object based on a condition, you describe how the UI should look as a function of the application's state. There is a clear flow of information that only moves in one direction. This is the preferred method when writing applications with React.\nThe code editor has a simple controlled input component with a styled border. You want to style this border red if the user types more than 15 characters of text in the input box. Add a condition to check for this and, if the condition is valid, set the input border style to 3px solid red. You can try it out by entering text in the input.\n\nclass GateKeeper extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      input: ''\n    };\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleChange(event) {\n    this.setState({ input: event.target.value })\n  }\n  render() {\n    let inputStyle = {\n      border: '1px solid black'\n    };\n    // change code below this line\n    if(this.state.input.length>15){\n      inputStyle={\n         border: '3px solid red'\n      }\n    }\n    // change code above this line\n    return (\n      \n        Don't Type Too Much:\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-arraymap-to-dynamically-render-elements.html":{"url":"react-use-arraymap-to-dynamically-render-elements.html","title":"React: Use Array.map() to Dynamically Render Elements","keywords":"","body":"React: Use Array.map() to Dynamically Render Elements\nConditional rendering is useful, but you may need your components to render an unknown number of elements. Often in reactive programming, a programmer has no way to know what the state of an application is until runtime, because so much depends on a user's interaction with that program. Programmers need to write their code to correctly handle that unknown state ahead of time. Using Array.map() in React illustrates this concept.\nFor example, you create a simple \"To Do List\" app. As the programmer, you have no way of knowing how many items a user might have on their list. You need to set up your component to dynamically render the correct number of list elements long before someone using the program decides that today is laundry day.\nThe code editor has most of the MyToDoList component set up. Some of this code should look familiar if you completed the controlled form challenge. You'll notice a textarea and a button, along with a couple of methods that track their states, but nothing is rendered to the page yet.\nInside the constructor, create a this.state object and define two states: userInput should be initialized as an empty string, and toDoList should be initialized as an empty array. Next, delete the comment in the render() method next to the items variable. In its place, map over the toDoList array stored in the component's internal state and dynamically render a li for each item. Try entering the string eat, code, sleep, repeat into the textarea, then click the button and see what happens.\nNote: You may know that all sibling child elements created by a mapping operation like this do need to be supplied with a unique key attribute.

However, there was an important piece missing from that example. When you create an array of elements, each one needs a key attribute set to a unique value. React uses these keys to keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way. Note that keys only need to be unique between sibling elements, they don't need to be globally unique in your application.\nThe code editor has an array with some front end frameworks and a stateless functional component named Frameworks(). Frameworks() needs to map the array to an unordered list, much like in the last challenge. Finish writing the map callback to return an li element for each framework in the frontEndFrameworks array. This time, make sure to give each li a key attribute, set to a unique value.\nNormally, you want to make the key something that uniquely identifies the element being rendered.

Normally, this is what you will always do. However, there are some use cases where it makes sense to render a React component on the server. Since React is a JavaScript view library and you can run JavaScript on the server with Node, this is possible. In fact, React provides a renderToString() method you can use for this purpose.\nThere are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. First, without doing this, your React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JavaScript when it's initially loaded to the browser. This may not be ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your pages so people can find you. If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client, the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines. Second, this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller than the JavaScript code of the entire app. React will still be able to recognize your app and manage it after the initial load.\nThe renderToString() method is provided on ReactDOMServer, which is available here as a global object. The method takes one argument which is a React element.

This means if you had a React app with ten components, and each component had its own local state, the entire state of your app would be defined by a single state object housed in the Redux store. This is the first important principle to understand when learning Redux: the Redux store is the single source of truth when it comes to application state.\nThis also means that any time any piece of your app wants to update state, it must do so through the Redux store. The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to track state management in your app.\nThe Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state. There is a method called createStore() on the Redux object, which you use to create the Redux store. This method takes a reducer function as a required argument. The reducer function is covered in a later challenge, and is already defined for you in the code editor. It simply takes state as an argument and returns state.\nDeclare a store variable and assign it to the createStore() method, passing in the reducer as an argument.\nNote: The code in the editor uses ES6 default argument syntax to initialize this state to hold a value of 5. If you're not familiar with default arguments, you can refer to the ES6 section in the Curriculum which covers this topic.\nconst reducer = (state = 5) => {\n  return state;\n}\n\n// Redux methods are available from a Redux object\n// For example: Redux.createStore()\n// Define the store here:\nconst store = Redux.createStore(reducer);\n"},"redux/redux-get-state-from-the-redux-store.html":{"url":"redux/redux-get-state-from-the-redux-store.html","title":"Redux: Get State from the Redux Store","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Get State from the Redux Store\nThe Redux store object provides several methods that allow you to interact with it.

Use store.getState() to retrieve the state from the store, and assign this to a new variable currentState.\nconst store = Redux.createStore(\n  (state = 5) => state\n);\n\n// change code below this line\nlet currentState = store.getState();\n"},"redux/redux-define-a-redux-action.html":{"url":"redux/redux-define-a-redux-action.html","title":"Redux: Define a Redux Action","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Define a Redux Action\nSince Redux is a state management framework, updating state is one of its core tasks. In Redux, all state updates are triggered by dispatching actions. An action is simply a JavaScript object that contains information about an action event that has occurred. The Redux store receives these action objects, then updates its state accordingly. Sometimes a Redux action also carries some data. For example, the action carries a username after a user logs in. While the data is optional, actions must carry a type property that specifies the 'type' of action that occurred.\nThink of Redux actions as messengers that deliver information about events happening in your app to the Redux store. The store then conducts the business of updating state based on the action that occurred.\nWriting a Redux action is as simple as declaring an object with a type property.

This is the job of a reducer function. Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A reducer takes state and action as arguments, and it always returns a new state. It is important to see that this is the only role of the reducer. It has no side effects — it never calls an API endpoint and it never has any hidden surprises. The reducer is simply a pure function that takes state and action, then returns new state.\nAnother key principle in Redux is that state is read-only. In other words, the reducer function must always return a new copy of state and never modify state directly. Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, you are responsible for enforcing it in the code of your reducer functions. You'll practice this in later challenges.\nThe code editor has the previous example as well as the start of a reducer function for you. Fill in the body of the reducer function so that if it receives an action of type 'LOGIN' it returns a state object with login set to true. Otherwise, it returns the current state.

You also need action creators that create actions corresponding to user login and user logout, along with the action objects themselves.\nThe code editor has a store, actions, and action creators set up for you. Fill in the reducer function to handle multiple authentication actions. Use a JavaScript switch statement in the reducer to respond to different action events. This is a standard pattern in writing Redux reducers. The switch statement should switch over action.type and return the appropriate authentication state.\nNote: At this point, don't worry about state immutability, since it is small and simple in this example. For each action, you can return a new object — for example, {authenticated: true}. Also, don't forget to write a default case in your switch statement that returns the current state. This is important because once your app has multiple reducers, they are all run any time an action dispatch is made, even when the action isn't related to that reducer.

Instead, remember the first principle of Redux: all app state is held in a single state object in the store. Therefore, Redux provides reducer composition as a solution for a complex state model. You define multiple reducers to handle different pieces of your application's state, then compose these reducers together into one root reducer. The root reducer is then passed into the Redux createStore() method.\nIn order to let us combine multiple reducers together, Redux provides the combineReducers() method. This method accepts an object as an argument in which you define properties which associate keys to specific reducer functions. The name you give to the keys will be used by Redux as the name for the associated piece of state.\nTypically, it is a good practice to create a reducer for each piece of application state when they are distinct or unique in some way. For example, in a note-taking app with user authentication, one reducer could handle authentication while another handles the text and notes that the user is submitting. For such an application, we might write the combineReducers() method like this:\nconst rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({\n  auth: authenticationReducer,\n  notes: notesReducer\n});\nNow, the key notes will contain all of the state associated with our notes and handled by our notesReducer. This is how multiple reducers can be composed to manage more complex application state.

You can also send specific data along with your actions. In fact, this is very common because actions usually originate from some user interaction and tend to carry some data with them. The Redux store often needs to know about this data.\nThere's a basic notesReducer() and an addNoteText() action creator defined in the code editor. Finish the body of the addNoteText() function so that it returns an action object. The object should include a type property with a value of ADD_NOTE, and also a text property set to the note data that's passed into the action creator.

That's all it takes to send action-specific data to the store and use it when you update store state.\nconst ADD_NOTE = 'ADD_NOTE';\n\nconst notesReducer = (state = 'Initial State', action) => {\n  switch(action.type) {\n    // change code below this line\n    case ADD_NOTE:\n      return action.text;\n    // change code above this line\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nconst addNoteText = (note) => {\n  // change code below this line\n  return {\n    type: ADD_NOTE,\n    text: note\n  }\n  // change code above this line\n};\n\nconst store = Redux.createStore(notesReducer);\n\nconsole.log(store.getState());\nstore.dispatch(addNoteText('Hello!'));\nconsole.log(store.getState());\n"},"redux/redux-use-middleware-to-handle-asynchronous-actions.html":{"url":"redux/redux-use-middleware-to-handle-asynchronous-actions.html","title":"Redux: Use Middleware to Handle Asynchronous Actions","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Use Middleware to Handle Asynchronous Actions\nSo far these challenges have avoided discussing asynchronous actions, but they are an unavoidable part of web development. At some point you'll need to call asynchronous endpoints in your Redux app, so how do you handle these types of requests? Redux provides middleware designed specifically for this purpose, called Redux Thunk middleware. Here's a brief description how to use this with Redux.\nTo include Redux Thunk middleware, you pass it as an argument to Redux.applyMiddleware(). This statement is then provided as a second optional parameter to the createStore() function. Take a look at the code at the bottom of the editor to see this. Then, to create an asynchronous action, you return a function in the action creator that takes dispatch as an argument. Within this function, you can dispatch actions and perform asynchronous requests.\nIn this example, an asynchronous request is simulated with a setTimeout() call. It's common to dispatch an action before initiating any asynchronous behavior so that your application state knows that some data is being requested (this state could display a loading icon, for instance). Then, once you receive the data, you dispatch another action which carries the data as a payload along with information that the action is completed.\nRemember that you're passing dispatch as a parameter to this special action creator. This is what you'll use to dispatch your actions, you simply pass the action directly to dispatch and the middleware takes care of the rest.\nWrite both dispatches in the handleAsync() action creator. Dispatch requestingData() before the setTimeout() (the simulated API call). Then, after you receive the (pretend) data, dispatch the receivedData() action, passing in this data. Now you know how to handle asynchronous actions in Redux. Everything else continues to behave as before.\nconst REQUESTING_DATA = 'REQUESTING_DATA'\nconst RECEIVED_DATA = 'RECEIVED_DATA'\n\nconst requestingData = () => { return {type: REQUESTING_DATA} }\nconst receivedData = (data) => { return {type: RECEIVED_DATA, users: data.users} }\n\nconst handleAsync = () => {\n  return function(dispatch) {\n    // dispatch request action here\n    dispatch(requestingData());\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      let data = {\n        users: ['Jeff', 'William', 'Alice']\n      }\n      // dispatch received data action here\n      dispatch(receivedData(data));\n    }, 2500);\n  }\n};\n\nconst defaultState = {\n  fetching: false,\n  users: []\n};\n\nconst asyncDataReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {\n  switch(action.type) {\n    case REQUESTING_DATA:\n      return {\n        fetching: true,\n        users: []\n      }\n    case RECEIVED_DATA:\n      return {\n        fetching: false,\n        users: action.users\n      }\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nconst store = Redux.createStore(\n  asyncDataReducer,\n  Redux.applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk.default)\n);\n"},"redux/redux-write-a-counter-with-redux.html":{"url":"redux/redux-write-a-counter-with-redux.html","title":"Redux: Write a Counter with Redux","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Write a Counter with Redux\nNow you've learned all the core principles of Redux! You've seen how to create actions and action creators, create a Redux store, dispatch your actions against the store, and design state updates with pure reducers. You've even seen how to manage complex state with reducer composition and handle asynchronous actions. These examples are simplistic, but these concepts are the core principles of Redux. If you understand them well, you're ready to start building your own Redux app. The next challenges cover some of the details regarding state immutability, but first, here's a review of everything you've learned so far.\nIn this lesson, you'll implement a simple counter with Redux from scratch. The basics are provided in the code editor, but you'll have to fill in the details! Use the names that are provided and define incAction and decAction action creators, the counterReducer(), INCREMENT and DECREMENT action types, and finally the Redux store. Once you're finished you should be able to dispatch INCREMENT or DECREMENT actions to increment or decrement the state held in the store. Good luck building your first Redux app!\nconst INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT'; // define a constant for increment action types\nconst DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT'; // define a constant for decrement action types\n\nconst counterReducer = (state=0,action) => {\n  switch(action.type){\n    case INCREMENT:\n    state++;\n    break;\n    case DECREMENT:\n    state--;\n    break;\n    default:\n    break;\n  }\n  return state;\n}; // define the counter reducer which will increment or decrement the state based on the action it receives\n\nconst incAction = () => ({type: INCREMENT}); // define an action creator for incrementing\n\nconst decAction = () => ({type: DECREMENT}); // define an action creator for decrementing\n\nconst store = Redux.createStore(counterReducer); // define the Redux store here, passing in your reducers\n"},"redux/redux-never-mutate-state.html":{"url":"redux/redux-never-mutate-state.html","title":"Redux: Never Mutate State","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Never Mutate State\nThese final challenges describe several methods of enforcing the key principle of state immutability in Redux. Immutable state means that you never modify state directly, instead, you return a new copy of state.\nIf you took a snapshot of the state of a Redux app over time, you would see something like state 1, state 2, state 3,state 4, ... and so on where each state may be similar to the last, but each is a distinct piece of data. This immutability, in fact, is what provides such features as time-travel debugging that you may have heard about.\nRedux does not actively enforce state immutability in its store or reducers, that responsibility falls on the programmer. Fortunately, JavaScript (especially ES6) provides several useful tools you can use to enforce the immutability of your state, whether it is a string, number, array, or object. Note that strings and numbers are primitive values and are immutable by nature. In other words, 3 is always 3. You cannot change the value of the number 3. An array or object, however, is mutable. In practice, your state will probably consist of an array or object, as these are useful data structures for representing many types of information.\nThere is a store and reducer in the code editor for managing to-do items. Finish writing the ADD_TO_DO case in the reducer to append a new to-do to the state. There are a few ways to accomplish this with standard JavaScript or ES6. See if you can find a way to return a new array with the item from action.todo appended to the end.\nconst ADD_TO_DO = 'ADD_TO_DO';\n\n// A list of strings representing tasks to do:\nconst todos = [\n  'Go to the store',\n  'Clean the house',\n  'Cook dinner',\n  'Learn to code',\n];\n\nconst immutableReducer = (state = todos, action) => {\n  switch(action.type) {\n    case ADD_TO_DO:\n      // don't mutate state here or the tests will fail\n    let arr = state.map(x => x);\n      arr.push(action.todo);\n      return arr;\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\n// an example todo argument would be 'Learn React',\nconst addToDo = (todo) => {\n  return {\n    type: ADD_TO_DO,\n    todo\n  }\n}\n\nconst store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);\n"},"redux/redux-use-the-spread-operator-on-arrays.html":{"url":"redux/redux-use-the-spread-operator-on-arrays.html","title":"Redux: Use the Spread Operator on Arrays","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Use the Spread Operator on Arrays\nOne solution from ES6 to help enforce state immutability in Redux is the spread operator: .... The spread operator has a variety of applications, one of which is well-suited to the previous challenge of producing a new array from an existing array. This is relatively new, but commonly used syntax. For example, if you have an array myArray and write:\nlet newArray = [...myArray];\nnewArray is now a clone of myArray. Both arrays still exist separately in memory. If you perform a mutation like newArray.push(5), myArray doesn't change. The ... effectively spreads out the values in myArray into a new array. To clone an array but add additional values in the new array, you could write [...myArray, 'new value']. This would return a new array composed of the values in myArray and the string 'new value' as the last value. The spread syntax can be used multiple times in array composition like this, but it's important to note that it only makes a shallow copy of the array. That is to say, it only provides immutable array operations for one-dimensional arrays.\nUse the spread operator to return a new copy of state when a to-do is added.\nconst immutableReducer = (state = ['Do not mutate state!'], action) => {\n  switch(action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_TO_DO':\n      let arr = [...state,action.todo]\n      return arr;\n      // don't mutate state here or the tests will fail\n      return\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nconst addToDo = (todo) => {\n  return {\n    type: 'ADD_TO_DO',\n    todo\n  }\n}\n\nconst store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);\n"},"redux/redux-remove-an-item-from-an-array.html":{"url":"redux/redux-remove-an-item-from-an-array.html","title":"Redux: Remove an Item from an Array","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Remove an Item from an Array\nTime to practice removing items from an array. The spread operator can be used here as well. Other useful JavaScript methods include slice() and concat().\nThe reducer and action creator were modified to remove an item from an array based on the index of the item. Finish writing the reducer so a new state array is returned with the item at the specific index removed.\nconst immutableReducer = (state = [0,1,2,3,4,5], action) => {\n  switch(action.type) {\n    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':\n      // don't mutate state here or the tests will fail\n      let newState = [...state];\n      newState.splice(action.index, 1);\n      return newState;\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n\nconst removeItem = (index) => {\n  return {\n    type: 'REMOVE_ITEM',\n    index\n  }\n}\n\nconst store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);\n"},"redux/redux-copy-an-object-with-objectassign.html":{"url":"redux/redux-copy-an-object-with-objectassign.html","title":"Redux: Copy an Object with Object.assign","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Copy an Object with Object.assign\nThe last several challenges worked with arrays, but there are ways to help enforce state immutability when state is an object, too. A useful tool for handling objects is the Object.assign() utility. Object.assign() takes a target object and source objects and maps properties from the source objects to the target object. Any matching properties are overwritten by properties in the source objects. This behavior is commonly used to make shallow copies of objects by passing an empty object as the first argument followed by the object(s) you want to copy. Here's an example:\nconst newObject = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);\nThis creates newObject as a new object, which contains the properties that currently exist in obj1 and obj2.\nThe Redux state and actions were modified to handle an object for the state. Edit the code to return a new state object for actions with type ONLINE, which set the status property to the string online.
