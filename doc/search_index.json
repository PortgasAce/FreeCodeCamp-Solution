Pass State as Props to Child Components","keywords":"","body":"React: Pass State as Props to Child Components\nYou saw a lot of examples that passed props to child JSX elements and child React components in previous challenges. You may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the state important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that state, which are passed in as props.\nFor example, maybe you have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components. In your App, you have state that contains a lot of user information, but the Navbar only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of state to the Navbar component as a prop.\nThis pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is unidirectional data flow. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.\nThe MyApp component is stateful and renders a Navbar component as a child. Pass the name property in its state down to the child component, then show the name in the h1 tag that's part of the Navbar render method.\nclass MyApp extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      name: 'CamperBot'\n    }\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n       \n         \n       \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nclass Navbar extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n    \n      Hello, my name is: {this.props.name} \n    \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-pass-a-callback-as-props.html":{"url":"react-pass-a-callback-as-props.html","title":"React: Pass a Callback as Props","keywords":"","body":"React: Pass a Callback as Props\nYou can pass state as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under this.props in the child component.\nThere are three components outlined in the code editor. The MyApp component is the parent that will render the GetInput and RenderInput child components. Add the GetInput component to the render method in MyApp, then pass it a prop called input assigned to inputValue from MyApp's state. Also create a prop called handleChange and pass the input handler handleChange to it.\nNext, add RenderInput to the render method in MyApp, then create a prop called input and pass the inputValue from state to it. Once you are finished you will be able to type in the input field in the GetInput component, which then calls the handler method in its parent via props. This updates the input in the state of the parent, which is passed as props to both children. Observe how the data flows between the components and how the single source of truth remains the state of the parent component. Admittedly, this example is a bit contrived, but should serve to illustrate how data and callbacks can be passed between React components.\nclass MyApp extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      inputValue: ''\n    }\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleChange(event) {\n    this.setState({\n      inputValue: event.target.value\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n       \n        { /* change code below this line */ }\n        \n        \n        { /* change code above this line */ }\n       \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nclass GetInput extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Get Input:\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n\nclass RenderInput extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Input Render:\n        {this.props.input}\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-the-lifecycle-method-componentwillmount.html":{"url":"react-use-the-lifecycle-method-componentwillmount.html","title":"React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount","keywords":"","body":"React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount\nReact components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. These are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks, and allow you to catch components at certain points in time. This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods:\ncomponentWillMount()\ncomponentDidMount()\ncomponentWillReceiveProps()\nshouldComponentUpdate()\ncomponentWillUpdate()\ncomponentDidUpdate()\ncomponentWillUnmount()\nThe next several lessons will cover some of the basic use cases for these lifecycle methods.\nThe componentWillMount() method is called before the render() method when a component is being mounted to the DOM. Log something to the console within componentWillMount() - you may want to have your browser console open to see the output.\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  componentWillMount() {\n    // change code below this line\n    console.log(\"componentWillMount\")\n    // change code above this line\n  }\n  render() {\n    return \n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-the-lifecycle-method-componentdidmount.html":{"url":"react-use-the-lifecycle-method-componentdidmount.html","title":"React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount","keywords":"","body":"React: Use the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount\nMost web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.\nThe best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method componentDidMount(). This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to setState() here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.\nThere is a mock API call in componentDidMount(). It sets state after 2.5 seconds to simulate calling a server to retrieve data. This example requests the current total active users for a site. In the render method, render the value of activeUsers in the h1.

This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.\nYou've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as onClick(). React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.\nAttach an event listener in the componentDidMount() method for keydown events and have these events trigger the callback handleKeyPress(). You can use document.addEventListener() which takes the event (in quotes) as the first argument and the callback as the second argument.\nThen, in componentWillUnmount(), remove this same event listener. You can pass the same arguments to document.removeEventListener(). It's good practice to use this lifecycle method to do any clean up on React components before they are unmounted and destroyed. Removing event listeners is an example of one such clean up action.\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      message: ''\n    };\n    this.handleEnter = this.handleEnter.bind(this);\n    this.handleKeyPress = this.handleKeyPress.bind(this);\n  }\n  // change code below this line\n  componentDidMount() {\n     document.addEventListener(\"keydown\",this.handleKeyPress);\n  }\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    document.removeEventListener(\"keydown\",this.handleKeyPress);\n  }\n  // change code above this line\n  handleEnter() {\n    this.setState({\n      message: this.state.message + 'You pressed the enter key!

This method receives the new props as an argument, which is usually written as nextProps. You can use this argument and compare with this.props and perform actions before the component updates. For example, you may call setState() locally before the update is processed.\nAnother method is componentDidUpdate(), and is called immediately after a component re-renders. Note that rendering and mounting are considered different things in the component lifecycle. When a page first loads, all components are mounted and this is where methods like componentWillMount() and componentDidMount() are called. After this, as state changes, components re-render themselves. The next challenge covers this in more detail.\nThe child component Dialog receives message props from its parent, the Controller component. Write the componentWillReceiveProps() method in the Dialog component and have it log this.props and nextProps to the console. You'll need to pass nextProps as an argument to this method and although it's possible to name it anything, name it nextProps here.\nNext, add componentDidUpdate() in the Dialog component, and log a statement that says the component has updated. This method works similar to componentWillUpdate(), which is provided for you. Now click the button to change the message and watch your browser console.

This is usually okay. But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new state or props, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. The method is shouldComponentUpdate(), and it takes nextProps and nextState as parameters.\nThis method is a useful way to optimize performance. For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new props, even if the props haven't changed. You can use shouldComponentUpdate() to prevent this by comparing the props. The method must return a boolean value that tells React whether or not to update the component. You can compare the current props (this.props) to the next props (nextProps) to determine if you need to update or not, and return true or false accordingly.\nThe shouldComponentUpdate() method is added in a component called OnlyEvens. Currently, this method returns true so OnlyEvens re-renders every time it receives new props. Modify the method so OnlyEvens updates only if the value of its new props is even.

But you may be wondering about the more simple problem of how to style those JSX elements you create in React. You likely know that it won't be exactly the same as working with HTML because of the way you apply classes to JSX elements.\nIf you import styles from a stylesheet, it isn't much different at all. You apply a class to your JSX element using the className attribute, and apply styles to the class in your stylesheet. Another option is to apply inline styles, which are very common in ReactJS development.\nYou apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. Here's an example of an inline style in HTML:\nMellow Yellow\nJSX elements use the style attribute, but because of the way JSX is transpiled, you can't set the value to a string. Instead, you set it equal to a JavaScript object. Here's an example:\nMellow Yellow\nNotice how we camelCase the \"fontSize\" property? This is because React will not accept kebab-case keys in the style object. React will apply the correct property name for us in the HTML.\nAdd a style attribute to the div in the code editor to give the text a color of red and font size of 72px.\nNote that you can optionally set the font size to be a number, omitting the units \"px\", or write it as \"72px\".\nclass Colorful extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      Big Red\n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-add-inline-styles-in-react.html":{"url":"react-add-inline-styles-in-react.html","title":"React: Add Inline Styles in React","keywords":"","body":"React: Add Inline Styles in React\nYou may have noticed in the last challenge that there were several other syntax differences from HTML inline styles in addition to the style attribute set to a JavaScript object. First, the names of certain CSS style properties use camel case. For example, the last challenge set the size of the font with fontSize instead of font-size. Hyphenated words like font-size are invalid syntax for JavaScript object properties, so React uses camel case. As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX.\nAll property value length units (like height, width, and fontSize) are assumed to be in px unless otherwise specified. If you want to use em, for example, you wrap the value and the units in quotes, like {fontSize: \"4em\"}. Other than the length values that default to px, all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.\nIf you have a large set of styles, you can assign a style object to a constant to keep your code organized. Uncomment the styles constant and declare an object with three style properties and their values. Give the div a color of \"purple\", a font-size of 40, and a border of \"2px solid purple\". Then set the style attribute equal to the styles constant.\nconst styles ={\"color\":\"purple\",\"fontSize\":40,\"border\":\"2px solid purple\"};\n// change code above this line\nclass Colorful extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    // change code below this line\n    return (\n      Style Me!\n    );\n    // change code above this line\n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-advanced-javascript-in-react-render-method.html":{"url":"react-use-advanced-javascript-in-react-render-method.html","title":"React: Use Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method","keywords":"","body":"React: Use Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method\nIn previous challenges, you learned how to inject JavaScript code into JSX code using curly braces, { }, for tasks like accessing props, passing props, accessing state, inserting comments into your code, and most recently, styling your components. These are all common use cases to put JavaScript in JSX, but they aren't the only way that you can utilize JavaScript code in your React components.\nYou can also write JavaScript directly in your render methods, before the return statement, without inserting it inside of curly braces. This is because it is not yet within the JSX code. When you want to use a variable later in the JSX code inside the return statement, you place the variable name inside curly braces.\nIn the code provided, the render method has an array that contains 20 phrases to represent the answers found in the classic 1980's Magic Eight Ball toy. The button click event is bound to the ask method, so each time the button is clicked a random number will be generated and stored as the randomIndex in state.

When the condition is true, one view renders. When it's false, it's a different view. You can do this with a standard if/else statement in the render() method of a React component.\nMyComponent contains a boolean in its state which tracks whether you want to display some element in the UI or not. The button toggles the state of this value. Currently, it renders the same UI every time. Rewrite the render() method with an if/else statement so that if display is true, you return the current markup. Otherwise, return the markup without the h1 element.\nNote: You must write an if/else to pass the tests.

Imagine that you are tracking several conditions in a component and you want different elements to render depending on each of these conditions. If you write a lot of else if statements to return slightly different UIs, you may repeat code which leaves room for error. Instead, you can use the && logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is true, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:\n{condition && markup}\nIf the condition is true, the markup will be returned. If the condition is false, the operation will immediately return false after evaluating the condition and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing && after each one. This allows you to handle more complex conditional logic in your render() method without repeating a lot of code.\nSolve the previous example again, so the h1 only renders if display is true, but use the && logical operator instead of an if/else statement.\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      display: true\n    }\n    this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);\n  }\n  toggleDisplay() {\n    this.setState({\n      display: !this.state.display\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    // change code below this line\n    return (\n       \n         Toggle Display\n         {this.state.display && Displayed!}\n       \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-use-a-ternary-expression-for-conditional-rendering.html":{"url":"react-use-a-ternary-expression-for-conditional-rendering.html","title":"React: Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering","keywords":"","body":"React: Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering\nBefore moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the ternary operator. The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for if/else statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional if/else statements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, if/else statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago — when an if/else statement was required, it was always outside the return statement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:\ncondition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse\nThe code editor has three constants defined within the CheckUserAge component's render() method. They are called buttonOne, buttonTwo, and buttonThree. Each of these is assigned a simple JSX expression representing a button element. First, initialize the state of CheckUserAge with input and userAge both set to values of an empty string.\nOnce the component is rendering information to the page, users should have a way to interact with it. Within the component's return statement, set up a ternary expression that implements the following logic: when the page first loads, render the submit button, buttonOne, to the page. Then, when a user enters their age and clicks the button, render a different button based on the age. If a user enters a number less than 18, render buttonThree. If a user enters a number greater than or equal to 18, render buttonTwo.\nconst inputStyle = {\n  width: 235,\n  margin: 5\n}\n\nclass CheckUserAge extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    // change code below this line\n    this.state={\n      input: '',\n      userAge: ''\n    }\n    // change code above this line\n    this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleChange(e) {\n    this.setState({\n      input: e.target.value,\n      userAge: ''\n    });\n  }\n  submit() {\n    this.setState({\n      userAge: this.state.input\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    const buttonOne = Submit;\n    const buttonTwo = You May Enter;\n    const buttonThree = You Shall Not Pass;\n    return (\n      \n        Enter Your Age to Continue\n        \n        {\n          ''===this.state.userAge ? buttonOne : (this.state.userAge\n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-render-conditionally-from-props.html":{"url":"react-render-conditionally-from-props.html","title":"React: Render Conditionally from Props","keywords":"","body":"React: Render Conditionally from Props\nSo far, you've seen how to use if/else, &&, null and the ternary operator (condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse) to make conditional decisions about what to render and when. However, there's one important topic left to discuss that lets you combine any or all of these concepts with another powerful React feature: props. Using props to conditionally render code is very common with React developers — that is, they use the value of a given prop to automatically make decisions about what to render.\nIn this challenge, you'll set up a child component to make rendering decisions based on props. You'll also use the ternary operator, but you can see how several of the other concepts that were covered in the last few challenges might be just as useful in this context.\nThe code editor has two components that are partially defined for you: a parent called GameOfChance, and a child called Results. They are used to create a simple game where the user presses a button to see if they win or lose.\nFirst, you'll need a simple expression that randomly returns a different value every time it is run. You can use Math.random(). This method returns a value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) each time it is called. So for 50/50 odds, use Math.random() > .5 in your expression. Statistically speaking, this expression will return true 50% of the time, and false the other 50%. On line 30, replace the comment with this expression to complete the variable declaration.\nNow you have an expression that you can use to make a randomized decision in the code. Next you need to implement this. Render the Results component as a child of GameOfChance, and pass in expression as a prop called fiftyFifty. In the Results component, write a ternary expression to render the text \"You win!\" or \"You lose!\" based on the fiftyFifty prop that's being passed in from GameOfChance. Finally, make sure the handleClick() method is correctly counting each turn so the user knows how many times they've played. This also serves to let the user know the component has actually updated in case they win or lose twice in a row.\nclass Results extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n      {\n        this.props.fiftyFifty ? \"You win!\":\"You lose!\"\n        /* change code here */\n      }\n      \n    )\n  };\n};\n\nclass GameOfChance extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      counter: 1\n    }\n    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleClick() {\n    this.setState({\n      counter: ++this.state.counter // change code here\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    let expression = Math.random() > .5; // change code here\n    return (\n      \n        Play Again\n        { /* change code below this line */ }\n        \n        { /* change code above this line */ }\n        {'Turn: ' + this.state.counter}\n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-change-inline-css-conditionally-based-on-component-state.html":{"url":"react-change-inline-css-conditionally-based-on-component-state.html","title":"React: Change Inline CSS Conditionally Based on Component State","keywords":"","body":"React: Change Inline CSS Conditionally Based on Component State\nAt this point, you've seen several applications of conditional rendering and the use of inline styles. Here's one more example that combines both of these topics. You can also render CSS conditionally based on the state of a React component. To do this, you check for a condition, and if that condition is met, you modify the styles object that's assigned to the JSX elements in the render method.\nThis paradigm is important to understand because it is a dramatic shift from the more traditional approach of applying styles by modifying DOM elements directly (which is very common with jQuery, for example). In that approach, you must keep track of when elements change and also handle the actual manipulation directly. It can become difficult to keep track of changes, potentially making your UI unpredictable. When you set a style object based on a condition, you describe how the UI should look as a function of the application's state. There is a clear flow of information that only moves in one direction. This is the preferred method when writing applications with React.\nThe code editor has a simple controlled input component with a styled border. You want to style this border red if the user types more than 15 characters of text in the input box.

Often in reactive programming, a programmer has no way to know what the state of an application is until runtime, because so much depends on a user's interaction with that program. Programmers need to write their code to correctly handle that unknown state ahead of time. Using Array.map() in React illustrates this concept.\nFor example, you create a simple \"To Do List\" app. As the programmer, you have no way of knowing how many items a user might have on their list. You need to set up your component to dynamically render the correct number of list elements long before someone using the program decides that today is laundry day.\nThe code editor has most of the MyToDoList component set up. Some of this code should look familiar if you completed the controlled form challenge. You'll notice a textarea and a button, along with a couple of methods that track their states, but nothing is rendered to the page yet.\nInside the constructor, create a this.state object and define two states: userInput should be initialized as an empty string, and toDoList should be initialized as an empty array. Next, delete the comment in the render() method next to the items variable. In its place, map over the toDoList array stored in the component's internal state and dynamically render a li for each item. Try entering the string eat, code, sleep, repeat into the textarea, then click the button and see what happens.\nNote: You may know that all sibling child elements created by a mapping operation like this do need to be supplied with a unique key attribute. Don't worry, this is the topic of the next challenge.\nconst textAreaStyles = {\n  width: 235,\n  margin: 5\n};\n\nclass MyToDoList extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    // change code below this line\n    this.state={\n      toDoList: [],\n      userInput:\"\"\n    }\n    // change code above this line\n    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n  }\n  handleSubmit() {\n    const itemsArray = this.state.userInput.split(',');\n    this.setState({\n      toDoList: itemsArray\n    });\n  }\n  handleChange(e) {\n    this.setState({\n      userInput: e.target.value\n    });\n  }\n  render() {\n    const items = this.state.toDoList.map((items) => ({items}));\n    return (\n      \n        \n        Create List\n        My \"To Do\" List:\n        \n          {items}\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-give-sibling-elements-a-unique-key-attribute.html":{"url":"react-give-sibling-elements-a-unique-key-attribute.html","title":"React: Give Sibling Elements a Unique Key Attribute","keywords":"","body":"React: Give Sibling Elements a Unique Key Attribute\nThe last challenge showed how the map method is used to dynamically render a number of elements based on user input. However, there was an important piece missing from that example. When you create an array of elements, each one needs a key attribute set to a unique value. React uses these keys to keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way. Note that keys only need to be unique between sibling elements, they don't need to be globally unique in your application.\nThe code editor has an array with some front end frameworks and a stateless functional component named Frameworks(). Frameworks() needs to map the array to an unordered list, much like in the last challenge. Finish writing the map callback to return an li element for each framework in the frontEndFrameworks array. This time, make sure to give each li a key attribute, set to a unique value.\nNormally, you want to make the key something that uniquely identifies the element being rendered. As a last resort the array index may be used, but typically you should try to use a unique identification.\nconst frontEndFrameworks = [\n  'React',\n  'Angular',\n  'Ember',\n  'Knockout',\n  'Backbone',\n  'Vue'\n];\n\nfunction Frameworks() {\n  const renderFrameworks = frontEndFrameworks.map((item)=>({item})); // change code here\n  return (\n    \n      Popular Front End JavaScript Frameworks\n      \n        {renderFrameworks}\n      \n    \n  );\n};\n"},"react-use-arrayfilter-to-dynamically-filter-an-array.html":{"url":"react-use-arrayfilter-to-dynamically-filter-an-array.html","title":"React: Use Array.filter() to Dynamically Filter an Array","keywords":"","body":"React: Use Array.filter() to Dynamically Filter an Array\nThe map array method is a powerful tool that you will use often when working with React. Another method related to map is filter, which filters the contents of an array based on a condition, then returns a new array. For example, if you have an array of users that all have a property online which can be set to true or false, you can filter only those users that are online by writing:\nlet onlineUsers = users.filter(user => user.online);\nIn the code editor, MyComponent's state is initialized with an array of users. Some users are online and some aren't. Filter the array so you see only the users who are online. To do this, first use filter to return a new array containing only the users whose online property is true. Then, in the renderOnline variable, map over the filtered array, and return a li element for each user that contains the text of their username. Be sure to include a unique key as well, like in the last challenges.\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      users: [\n        {\n          username: 'Jeff',\n          online: true\n        },\n        {\n          username: 'Alan',\n          online: false\n        },\n        {\n          username: 'Mary',\n          online: true\n        },\n        {\n          username: 'Jim',\n          online: false\n        },\n        {\n          username: 'Sara',\n          online: true\n        },\n        {\n          username: 'Laura',\n          online: true\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  render() {\n    const usersOnline = this.state.users.filter((user)=>(user.online)); // change code here\n    const renderOnline = usersOnline.map((user)=>({user.username})); // change code here\n    return (\n       \n         Current Online Users:\n         \n           {renderOnline}\n         \n       \n    );\n  }\n};\n"},"react-render-react-on-the-server-with-rendertostring.html":{"url":"react-render-react-on-the-server-with-rendertostring.html","title":"React: Render React on the Server with renderToString","keywords":"","body":"React: Render React on the Server with renderToString\nSo far, you have been rendering React components on the client. Normally, this is what you will always do. However, there are some use cases where it makes sense to render a React component on the server. Since React is a JavaScript view library and you can run JavaScript on the server with Node, this is possible. In fact, React provides a renderToString() method you can use for this purpose.\nThere are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. First, without doing this, your React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JavaScript when it's initially loaded to the browser. This may not be ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your pages so people can find you. If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client, the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines. Second, this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller than the JavaScript code of the entire app. React will still be able to recognize your app and manage it after the initial load.\nThe renderToString() method is provided on ReactDOMServer, which is available here as a global object. The method takes one argument which is a React element. Use this to render App to a string.\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return \n  }\n};\n\n// change code below this line\nReactDOMServer.renderToString();\n"},"redux.html":{"url":"redux.html","title":"Redux","keywords":"","body":""},"redux/redux-create-a-redux-store.html":{"url":"redux/redux-create-a-redux-store.html","title":"Redux: Create a Redux Store","keywords":"","body":"Redux: Create a Redux Store\nRedux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of different web technologies, including React.\nIn Redux, there is a single state object that's responsible for the entire state of your application. This means if you had a React app with ten components, and each component had its own local state, the entire state of your app would be defined by a single state object housed in the Redux store. This is the first important principle to understand when learning Redux: the Redux store is the single source of truth when it comes to application state.\nThis also means that any time any piece of your app wants to update state, it must do so through the Redux store. The unidirectional data flow makes it easier to track state management in your app.\nThe Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state. There is a method called createStore() on the Redux object, which you use to create the Redux store. This method takes a reducer function as a required argument. The reducer function is covered in a later challenge, and is already defined for you in the code editor. It simply takes state as an argument and returns state.\nDeclare a store variable and assign it to the createStore() method, passing in the reducer as an argument.\nNote: The code in the editor uses ES6 default argument syntax to initialize this state to hold a value of 5. If you're not familiar with default arguments, you can refer to the ES6 section in the Curriculum which covers this topic.\n\n\n"}}}
