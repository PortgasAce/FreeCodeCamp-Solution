Basic HTML and HTML5: Create a Form Element
You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action on your form element.

For example:
```
<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>
```

Nest your text field inside a form element, and add the action="/submit-cat-photo" attribute to the form element.

```
