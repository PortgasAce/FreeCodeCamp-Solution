Basic HTML and HTML5: Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements
You can use anchor elements to link to content outside of your web page.

anchor elements need a destination web address called an href attribute. They also need anchor text. Here's an example:
```
<a href="https://freecodecamp.org">this links to freecodecamp.org</a>
```
Then your browser will display the text "this links to freecodecamp.org" as a link you can click. And that link will take you to the web address https://www.freecodecamp.org.


Create an a element that links to http://freecatphotoapp.com and has "cat photos" as its anchor text.

```
