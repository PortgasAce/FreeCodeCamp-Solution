Basic HTML and HTML5: Comment out HTML
Remember that in order to start a comment, you need to use `<!-- and to end a comment, you need to use -->`

Here you'll need to end the comment before your h2 element begins.


Comment out your h1 element and your p element, but not your h2 element.

```
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>
-->

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<!--
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
-->
```
