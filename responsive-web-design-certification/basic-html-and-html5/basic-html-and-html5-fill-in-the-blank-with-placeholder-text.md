Basic HTML and HTML5: Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text
Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. The 'lorem ipsum' text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, let's use something called kitty ipsum text.


Replace the text inside your p element with the first few words of this kitty ipsum text: Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.
