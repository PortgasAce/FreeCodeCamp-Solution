Basic HTML and HTML5: Create a Bulleted Unordered List
HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point style lists.

Unordered lists start with an opening `<ul>` element, followed by any number of `<li>` elements. Finally, unordered lists close with a `</ul>`

For example:
```
<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
```
would create a bullet point style list of "milk" and "cheese".


Remove the last two p elements and create an unordered list of three things that cats love at the bottom of the page.
