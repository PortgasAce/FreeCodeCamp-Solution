Basic HTML and HTML5: Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field
Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputted anything.

You can create placeholder text like so:
```
<input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">
```

Set the placeholder value of your text input to "cat photo URL".

```
