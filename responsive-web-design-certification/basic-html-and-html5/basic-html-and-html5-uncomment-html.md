Basic HTML and HTML5: Uncomment HTML
Commenting is a way that you can leave comments for other developers within your code without affecting the resulting output that is displayed to the end user.

Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

Comments in HTML starts with `<!--, and ends with a -->`


Uncomment your h1, h2 and p elements.

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
