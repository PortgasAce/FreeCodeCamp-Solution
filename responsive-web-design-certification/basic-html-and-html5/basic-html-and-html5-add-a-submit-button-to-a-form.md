Basic HTML and HTML5: Add a Submit Button to a Form
Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the data from your form to the URL you specified with your form's action attribute.

Here's an example submit button:
```
<button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>
```

Add a button as the last element of your form element with a type of submit, and "Submit" as its text.
