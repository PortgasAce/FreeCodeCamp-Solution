Basic HTML and HTML5: Create an Ordered List
HTML has another special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered lists.

Ordered lists start with an opening `<ol>` element, followed by any number of `<li>` elements. Finally, ordered lists close with a `</ol>`

For example:
```
<ol>
  <li>Garfield</li>
  <li>Sylvester</li>
</ol>
```
would create a numbered list of "Garfield" and "Sylvester".


Create an ordered list of the top 3 things cats hate the most.
